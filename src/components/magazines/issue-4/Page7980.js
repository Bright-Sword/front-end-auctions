        Through DIGIFIZZY we are proving out a new publishing model with NFT based decentralised subscriptions. All of the content is free to read, and, people can subscribe to NFT bundles that bring together a mix of well known and upcoming/undervalued talent across music, art, fashion, gaming, other collectibles etc. This is not an auction or a typical drop, but unlike where if creators were featured on the cover of a magazine they would get nothing for it or sometimes have to pay for placement, here they get a share distributed across the contributors to the bundle, whilst the publication is still able to prove out the model through a majority share, being the core creator, engineer, distributor and contributor.
