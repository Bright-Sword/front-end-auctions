        We’ve seen that happen when web2 democratised information, revolutionised commerce, and changed publishing as we knew it. Communities were reshuffled and galvanised, missions and visions were recalibrated, and massive value was generated borne from the synergies and creative links that the technology itself brings.
        <br /><br />
        History is repeating itself with web3. 
        <br /><br />
        And the signs are pointing towards the ultimate fragmentation—or unbundling, as it were—of Amazon and the Commerce 2.0 giants just as the web2 sails the inexorable tide to web3.
        <br /><br />
        NFTs, for instance, have come to represent new forms of exchanging value and conducting decentralised commerce. 
        <br /><br />
        The layer of value that NFTs add to the DeCo equation make the prospects of a truly decentralised manner of commerce tantalising—a trustless, peer-to-peer system of value exchange serving as a direct affront to the pervasive gatekeeping inherent in traditional commerce.
        <br /><br />
        E-commerce’s dealbreakers of exorbitant commissions, unethical labor practices, insanely high barriers to entry, incessant middlemanning, and payment processing friction can all be settled with decentralisation.
        <br /><br />
        #DeCo is the ultimate solution to extricating business from the mire that centralisation has left it in.
        <br /><br />
        There will be haters—vested interests of maximalists who could be facing an existential crisis as adoption takes hold. It’s the same lifecycle in commerce, time and time again. The big box stores, malls, and physical retail stores from a seemingly antediluvian past were dragged into e-commerce kicking and screaming, lest they perish. And many did perish.
        <br /><br />
        Decentralisation is simply inevitable at this point as web2 eats itself, and as blockchain protocols, DeFi, DeCo, DAOs, and NFTs are changing the landscape, we all have the agency to choose which side our bread is buttered.
