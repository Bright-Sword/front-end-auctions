        We’ve seen that happen when web2 democratised information, revolutionised commerce, and changed publishing as we knew it. Communities were reshuffled and galvanised, missions and visions were recalibrated, and massive value was generated borne from the synergies and creative links that the technology itself brings.
        <br /><br />
        History is repeating itself with web3. 
        <br /><br />
        And the signs are pointing towards the ultimate fragmentation—or unbundling, as it were—of Amazon and the Commerce 2.0 giants just as the web2 sails the inexorable tide to web3.
        <br /><br />
        NFTs, for instance, have come to represent new forms of exchanging value and conducting decentralised commerce. 
        <br /><br />
        The layer of value that NFTs add to the DeCo equation make the prospects of a truly decentralised manner of commerce tantalising—a trustless, peer-to-peer system of value exchange serving as a direct affront to the pervasive gatekeeping inherent in traditional commerce.
        <br /><br />
        E-commerce’s dealbreakers of exorbitant commissions, unethical labor practices, insanely high barriers to entry, incessant middlemanning, and payment processing friction can all be settled with decentralisation.
        <br /><br />
        #DeCo is the ultimate solution to extricating business from the mire that centralisation has left it in.
        <br /><br />
        There will be haters—vested interests of maximalists who could be facing an existential crisis as adoption takes hold. It’s the same lifecycle in commerce, time and time again. The big box stores, malls, and physical retail stores from a seemingly antediluvian past were dragged into e-commerce kicking and screaming, lest they perish. And many did perish.
        <br /><br />
        Decentralisation is simply inevitable at this point as web2 eats itself, and as blockchain protocols, DeFi, DeCo, DAOs, and NFTs are changing the landscape, we all have the agency to choose which side our bread is buttered.

        With Layer 2s and side chains being all the rave, have you ever wondered what the flow of activity and token transfers really is between Ethereum mainnet and these

        other protocols? Stakewatch has deployed an interactive web interface for tracking exactly this, but, in a human friendly way with Ethhole.link. The total value tracked is calculated by tokens deposit to bridge contracts and the staked tokens on Ethereum.

        For the majority of people, understanding complex algorithmic DeFi protocols isn’t something that can just be contemplated over in simple time. Yield farming, staking, yield aggregators, swaps, flash loans etc. come as a completely new language, heuristic and behavior. And, especially as DeFi grows and scales in terms of the number of projects and protocols building and releasing products in the space; it becomes even more difficult to separate the signal from the noise and know exactly where one should go to find reasonably protected exposure to gainz. 
        <br/><br/>
        Aggregators are a fundamental building block for scaling DeFi and crypto to a wider audience, and Illuminate is supporting this cause by offering a Fixed Yield Aggregator that finds the best current fixed rate yield across a number of different protocols, simplifying the experience for users as they start exploring this new field.

        We’ve all heard the gamification buzzword a bunch of times. But what does it mean and why do we need it? Well, ultimately, it’s all about guiding the user’s experience in a way that is more engaging and appealing for them, so that they can achieve the outcome, goal or skill better, faster and with a much higher guarantee of root rentention. 
        <br/><br/>
        THX is bringing gamification to the blockchain, running on Polygon, where their API allows for easily embedded blockchain powered gamification in any application. Their focus is particularly centred around strengthening DAO communities through gamification, specifically when it comes to voting, money management and use cases around loyalty programs. 
        <br/><br/>
        They also currently have discord integration compatibility— highly relevant for a lot of DAOs building their communities today.

        The open source alternative to Infura— Kotal is an API gateway for deploying self managing blockchain infrastructure. Anything from Ethereum 2 beacon and validation nodes to Filecoin nodes and private Ethereum networks. It’s cloud agnostic, running on any public or private cloud that supports Kubernetes and it allows for key reuseability across multiple blockchain nodes and networks.
