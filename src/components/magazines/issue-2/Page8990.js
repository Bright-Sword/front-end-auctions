      Sheantoz Story

      <p className={styles.text4}>
Sheantoz is an intergalactic alien singer from a distant future. She has an unique and powerful voice that can both fascinate  and enchant the audience with just a single song. She is originally from a planet called Saquarious, where her species has blue color skin and the ability to breath under waterâ€” her planet is 60% liquid water and 30% iced water. Only %10 of the planet is solid land, where the enemy species rules. 
<br/>
<br/>
Sheantoz was once captured by enemy forces for their own amusement, however, her voice was able to enchant the soldiers, allowing her to escape via space craft. 
<br/>
<br/>
Ever since, she has been roaming from one planet to the next, travelling across galaxies. She plans one day to also visit Earth, giving a concert to her fans and using her voice for the greater good.
