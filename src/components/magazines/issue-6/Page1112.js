        DAOs and decentralized web3 communities are the next logical evolution of how humans organize and coordinate resources. They serve as the neighborhoods our virtual selves “live” in. 
        <br /><br />
        But joining a web3 community isn’t as simple as just buying an NFT, joining a Discord server, and then sitting with your fingers up your ass expecting the world to cater to you. It doesn’t work like that. 
        <br /><br />
        Yes, they are permissionless. Yes, they are decentralized. But the lifeblood of web3 community is action.
        <br /><br />
        It’s about engaging and incentivizing its members to build up the community proactively. And in doing so, improve the network, improve themselves, and lift the efforts of the entire organization in line with its aims.
        <br /><br />
        It’s an entirely different paradigm from the legacy web community’s passive consumption.
        <br /><br />
        Web3 communities may be smaller as far as size is concerned compared to those whose businesses are supported by advertising–but the difference is when the community is committed to creating content, cooperating, and collaborating on projects beneficial to the group.
        <br /><br />
        And contrary to what you might think, there IS a community for you out there. There are a plethora of interests out there with a community with your name on it–whatever your passion might be.
        <br /><br />
        Rather, decentralized communities thrive on active participation and direct engagement with the participants and the community at large. 
        <br /><br />
        And like anything IRL, you get what you put in.
        <br /><br />
        That said, you don’t need to be a Solidity dev to become part of a DAO. There are so many aspects of web3 communities whose ecosystems go beyond the gamut of just development. We’re talking about design, marketing, community management, onboarding, education, practically anything–where anybody with an iota of transferable skill can provide value and contribute to the community’s goals from the get-go.

        NFTs are a fantastic way to get your feet wet in web3 because they enable community and ownership. But what do you do once you’re in? How do you take action?
        <br /><br />
        Context is key. You can’t just show up in a community you don’t know from Adam and expect to contribute right away. Before contributing to a web3 community, you need to understand its vision, goals, and direction and determine whether it aligns with your passion, purpose, and beliefs.
        <br /><br />
        Then, you need to get a good mind map of its ecosystem and how it works. That’s when you can begin to find your sweet spot within the community. Participate. Make yourself heard. Determine how much time and effort you can give to the community you wish to be part of, but don’t spread yourself too thin. Being more discerning means you’ll make more meaningful, longer-lasting relationships in the communities you choose to participate in.
        <br /><br />
        Better yet, apart from immersing yourself in countless Discord servers, Crypto Twitter, Telegram, and all the usual suspects, there’s a tool that makes it even easier for you to set your course towards web3 via Wayfare–the Discord bot designed specifically to help individuals find their DAOs, and for DAOs to find the right individuals to contribute to their respective communities. Head on to the DIGITALAX discord to see what the fuss is all about.
        <br /><br />
        Core web3 communities are open, kind, inclusive, and some of the nicest and most amazing, inspiring, and dynamic people you will ever meet, despite the existing barriers. It’s all about finding the right ones to guide you on your quest.
        <br /><br />
        If you’re still on the fence about diving deeper into web3, let me tell you from personal experience: your skills are transferable. There’s a place for you on the team. It’s early AF. It’s going to be a wild ride, and it’s going to be oodles and oodles of fun.
        <br /><br />
        The best part? It’s not always about the money or the status. It’s not always about the “I’m-cooler-than-thou” posturing. It’s not always about the clout and who has the most followers. It’s just about the people. Don’t make any mistake – web3 is where the party’s at.
        <br /><br />
        Find your tribe, find your purpose, find your place, and once you do, double down on it. Big time.
