        My first exposure to web three, was before it was web three. So I guess like, really Bitcoin
        in 2011. I was 17 years old and I actually feel like I came across Bitcoin sooner than that,
        but this is for sure when I was actually transacting and exploring, and using it. And this
        was during the time when Bitcoin shot up to $32, and that was a huge deal. It subsequently
        crashed down, but before, that it was trading around $1 or less. But basically, that was my
        first exposure to crypto networks the idea that you can have this trust in money, because
        prior to that I was trying to make money on the internet in various ways. I remember I made
        $100, which was a lot at the time, I was sending traffic to one of those “every sign up, you
        get you get $1” from this company– like an affiliate program. But I was able to make a
        website. Now I didn't code it, but get a website web page online. And, you know, get like
        100 people to sign up maybe a bit more. And I remember, they paid out via PayPal. And this
        was like, maybe when I was like 13 or something. So I made a PayPal account. And like, it
        wasn't until like maybe a couple years later, that it got shut down. Because they found out
        I wasn't 18. And then they froze like money that I had in like six months or whatever. So I
        used one of those things where the fact that no one could shut down my digital bank account
        so to speak was really cool.
        <br />
        <br />
        And I actually was lucky enough to have my own checking account, and debit card. So it's
        really nice, as someone who grew up on the internet, to be able to transact really, so to
        speak. And I guess fast forward to and Ethereum kind of came across my radar around January/
        February of 2016. So it's a bit after, a theory is that after the ICO of Ethereum and
        everything because because I kind of stopped being up to date with crypto things. And this
        is the sort of trend for me on and off because I tend to get historically disillusioned by I
        guess the progress or lack of progress and sort of the focus on sort of just replicating
        Wall Street and sort of like libertarian ideals on the blockchain and crypto networks. So I
        would often go back and forth. And I actually was really into it that spring up until into
        the summer. And then when The DAO hack happened, the original one where they forked it that
        actually caused me to lose interest because I actually thought I was against the fork.
        Because I thought it was like kind of unfair that these people who had a bunch of Ether
        already were getting bailed out. And it felt like the exact like opposite of what it should
        be. Obviously, you know, it worked out, I guess. But then roughly a year later I like
        started getting more involved again and then I guess into 2018 I did a bunch of hackathons
        like Eth Denver and in San Francisco, I contributed to Gitcoin bounties and just kind kept
        up with the space and everything but it was always secondary to my main line of work which
        was like just normal software engineering for web two companies and I would say that I never
        really felt like there was a right time to fully jump in. But that time did come in like
        April/ May of this year I had decided to leave a company I co founded the year prior called
        Sunroom. It was a creator focused product platform, kind of trying to take the best parts of
        only fans and, and Instagram and Patreon and make it better for women who are creators
        online. So I basically just Had primarily through FWB had really gotten to know a lot of
        people who are not just like the typical people who had historically been in crypto. And it
        was really cool. And for a confluence of reasons I basically felt like comfortable enough to
        go all in whatever that might mean; I didn't really know what that would look like. But I
        knew that for whatever reason maybe it's like the fact that DAOs are like an integral part
        of web three, and in fact that there is no more just like decentralized Wall Street, I mean
        there’s so much more than just direct finance in the space. I think it just seems like there
        was the people I was looking for, who I could relate to and are thinking about abundance
        versus scarcity. Because obviously, crypto networks do a good job of creating scarcity,
        that's one of the remarkable things about them. For the first time in history, you can have
        scarcity without force, without monopoly or violence. And I think that's created some really
        remarkable things. But I think if anything, like we can use that digital scarcity, to create
        abundance in real life, and that's kind of a theme of a lot of my tweets, and what I've
        decided to start tweeting about because, you know, if we can have scarcity games, as I like
        to call them online, then, we really can have abundant systems in real life. And I think
        that's what's really cool, and what gets me so excited about it.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text2}>
        I think in general, DAOs are kind of like a catch all phrase where underneath the phrase of
        DAO are whole ecosystems of different types of vowels. I've tried to clarify them
        personally, do I think of impact hours, which are more akin to nonprofits or social impact
        companies or social enterprise companies and traditional corporations. And then there's
        personal DAOs, which was a new category, I'm excited about where it's really just, not even
        a social token, but more of just like, with people. I'm trying to make a personal dow for
        myself. The idea is infrastructure for being independent, but also working closely with
        people. And then there's, obviously collector DAOs and investment DAOs and creative DAOs. I
        really think DAOs are similar to web three itself, where it's so broad that it can make some
        people mad. You know, I think there's DAO purists who are like a DAO has to be a limited
        definition. But then there's people who are more excited about DAO and the word DAO being a
        meme. Not like in a funny picture, but just like a concept or construct that like people can
        relate to. There's this blog post that thing, it's by one of the people who work on party
        bid. Think john Palmer, maybe he talks about like scissor words or scissor labels, as this
        idea of like words that are common like to the vernacular of the internet, but like, sort of
        have, I guess, disagreement over what it means like so for example, like the word hipster.
        Like some people said it meant there's some people said it meant something else. There's
        lots of like, words like that. I think like that article has been helpful in terms of me
        thinking about, like, how to map the space, because like, I think everyone's trying to, like
        have their definition of dogs become like the canonical definition. But I think at this
        point that the words kind of public domain, the same way that NF T's are, and I think the
        reason I'm here is talking about all this stuff is like it's important when you're making an
        organization in web three, or a group, or I guess, a doubt to think about, like, what type
        of subcategory of a doll you want to be because not every not every, I guess, group of
        people collaborating needs to be fully decentralized or fully autonomous, or, you know,
        fully. I guess, like, it doesn't have to be like, you know, 1000 people working together.
        And I think it's become clear that like, most successful vows are often like a core group of
        contributors. And then people orbiting around those contributors. Someone made a chart on
        Twitter, I thought, or a graphic that I thought was cool. It's basically like, multiple
        circles, like inside those circles are different layers of the doubt. And it's kind of like
        you think about there might be like, 10, core team members being supported by like, 1000,
        like, people on the periphery. And I think that's like totally fine. Also, I think, like,
        it's important to find like people who, I guess it's important to be on the same page about,
        like, what type of organization you are, like, some of the, I guess, groups that I am a part
        of, it's easy to sort of just call them a doubt, but we're not necessarily a dow, if
        anything, we're almost like a squad or like, a group of squads like working together to like
        achieve bigger goals. So yeah, I think like, that's the way I think about it. It's like,
        more just like people working together and dowser, like a label that, like, helps people
        think about stuff, you know,nk that's what's really cool, and what gets me so excited about
        it.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text3}>
        I think dows are more like a state of mind. And less of like, the actual like tools that
        you're using, like, to me it's about intent. Because like, it's still even though there are
        like no code ways to get started with on chain governance, whether it be like off chain,
        voting a snapshot, and then like, executing those votes on chain, like we don't have the
        tooling that's like accessible for everyone to like, fully be on chain. So at least like
        that's my opinion, where I'm not like a dog purist. I think like if the intent is to, I
        guess eventually like, become like leverage on chain Tools when you have the resources, or
        if you're like, I think like gnosis safe is like a good example of like, you can have like a
        group of trusted signers, maybe it's like five, or even three. And that's like sufficient.
        If it's like, a smaller, let's just say 30 member dial. And this is again, a real example of
        like a dow that I'm part of, or, you know, maybe it's not a doubt, but like, just like web
        three native org. And it's one of those things where we're like working to, like have, I
        guess, the will of the DAO members be translated without, like having to trust the other
        members. But in the meantime, like, we do have a fairly like, democratic system. And I think
        like, if anything, like, if anything, dow should probably be called, like, democratic, like,
        autonomous organizations or something. And maybe like, the word autonomous isn't even
        accurate either. But I don't think that like the, the on chain component is, is necessary
        from the get go. If it's, like prohibitive to like starting, but I do think like, as like,
        tools become, essentially, if it becomes easier to like, do the on chain version of
        collaboration, I would sort of begin to begin to like, include that in a definition, but
        like, the accessibility of like spinning up a fully like on chain, organization. And that's
        like, still, like not accessible, whether it be for cost or expertise. And I think that is
        going to change, like, I'm working on stuff to hopefully change it. So many smart people are
        every day, so. But yeah, it kind of goes back to intent, like if people are like thinking
        about this, and like, sort of the ethos of web three in Dallas, and sort of what that means,
        like, I think that's like a huge step forward than like traditional organizations.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sure. I mean, there's like tons of cool stuff, like almost too many cool things for one
        person to keep track of. And I think that is, you know, I guess it obvious results of the
        growth of the space. So I mean, obviously, I think anyone who's working on stuff, we'll
        think that their stuff is cool. But there's also a lot of things that like I'm not working
        on just because I don't have the time that I think are cool as well. I mean, I guess like to
        shout out some stuff that I'm not working on, specifically that I think are in early stages,
        but are cool. A lot of the the I guess groups they got into seed clubs, latest cohort, I
        think are pretty cool. There's some earlier somewhere like later in progress, but like, I
        think c club was just for those who aren't familiar, like C close a, I guess, sort of like Y
        Combinator for social tokens and dows. And for those who don't know what Y Combinator is, Y
        Combinator is like an accelerator program for startups that's been in Silicon Valley so I
        think like there's one that's like trying to buy an NBA team it's called like, Krauss house
        or something. I like that as like a doll just because it's like so such a big goal. And I
        think I think there's obviously going to be like dogs that are needed like that are tackling
        smaller problems. But I think it's like really interesting to like, see how a dow could like
        achieve something that like maybe a private group of people wouldn't be able to do? Because
        I mean, the internet's being able to do like lots of amazing things sort of through like the
        crowd, you know, effort whether it be crowd funding or just like crowd intelligence and I
        think that one's kind of cool. Like I personally like would like wanted out like to do
        something similar. amounts of money but like, maybe not by a basketball team, but I think
        like the fact that like people are trying to do and I think they actually could someday do
        it is like a good testament to what like dows and web three are capable of. So that's like
        one I guess like other ones that I think are cool. I think there's just like a lot of cool
        like social communities sprouting up where it really does just start in a Discord. But I
        think like the reason they're doing better than traditional, like web to communities is
        because even if they don't have like a token yet, there's this like, sort of belief and
        understanding that, like, ownership will be collective. And I think that like goes a long
        way to like, like, incentivizing people to actually like, focus their energy on like, sort
        of communities that they really vibe with and everything. Like there's this one that I'm a
        part of that just like is like a few weeks old, but it's like a really, it's already like,
        come up started to become like a really cool like group. I think it's just started by
        someone who wanted like, this, like specific like, intersection of people, it's called, like
        web three bodies or whatever. And try to find the Twitter. But basically, it's just like, I
        don't know, it's not even just like limited to women, but it's just like, people, it's just
        like a, almost like saying like this, these are like, this is like the vibes who want to
        like, cultivate. And that's like bringing this into, into motion. So I think that's like one
        of my favorite parts about this, like, space is like, it's really like, it really is like
        non competitive. It's like, abundance versus scarcity. Like, you know, I think like in web
        two, like if someone was starting, like a slack group or something, and someone started
        another one, it would seem like, oh, there's too many or something. But I think like,
        there's enough like slices of the internet for everyone to like, have their own like sub
        community. And then you can like jump between them, you don't have to like, just be a part
        of one community.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text4}>
        And then I guess like in terms of stuff I'm working on. I generally like to be working on
        like three or four things at any given time. But I also have like, periods of time where I
        figure out like, what those like things are going to be if I'm like switching into a
        different thing. And this like past few months, I've been finding those few things. And so
        like my main like, semi serious like software project is called counter. And to start were
        working on web three campaigns, like, almost like a Kickstarter campaign built in, I guess
        connected to a down a box. So you can think of it sort of as like a femoral dows, where if
        you want to raise money to like do some on chain stuff with like a group of people, maybe a
        group of people you already know, or just like people on the internet, there are like tools
        for doing that such as like party bid or mere crowd funds. But I think like, there's not
        really like a flexible solution that can be used in like lots of different contexts. So I'm
        working on that right now as kind of a result of like my experiences this summer just like
        participating in a lot of these types of like collective wealth creation. And it's a sort of
        a result of like what I felt was needed. So that's like one of my that's like my main like
        software project that I'm actively working on. And then there's an investment club basically
        that I started with some people from friends with benefits that's investing in metaverse
        assets. We notably, maybe semi notably raised, like $1.7 million, and then returned it,
        because we realized that like the SEC would probably get mad at us based on the way we
        raised that we raised it via Mears crowdfund functionality, but technically are offering
        like a security, which is one, one thing and then we are also violating the 40 Act if we
        were to like go ahead with that. So for USB people that like is like a bad thing. So that is
        like on papers, just like a group of people co investing with metaverse assets and like
        we're working to like figure out how to do that without breaking the rules too much, maybe
        breaking some rules. But also like the goal of that is to figure out how like, normal people
        not just accredited investors can get access to the upside of like, I guess the metaverse in
        the emerging like assets that come with it. So that's like a second thing and then the third
        project that I am There's actually probably like four or five things but the third project
        is I'm helping out with heat though, which is kind of, I'd say like I'm a more involved like
        technical adviser, like I'm actively involved but I'm not like I'm mostly focused on making
        sure that the team has access to the technical resources and insights and he was trying to
        basically build like a motion data marketplace or movement data, whatever you want to call
        it, which is almost like imagine you could like you were came up with this really cool dance
        move and you wanted to record that with motion capture and then make that motion data as an
        NFT that I think is really cool and I'm excited personally about the the tech aspect of it
        and just like the fact that like this is like it's using a lot of cutting edge technologies
        but I think it's gonna be really cool and then this fourth one isn't fully like public yet
        so if like it's not public, by the time you're like posting this we can just not include it.
        But basically I'm going to be a venture partner for seed club ventures like their I guess
        this is that also is like not playing out yet but C club is launching like a venture fund.
        And I'm going to be like a part time venture partner which is kind of hilarious because I
        have a lot of thoughts about like venture capital, and VCs in general. But um, I'm hoping
        that like, based on like my experience on the other end of receiving funding and like, you
        know, just like being a software engineer historically like I'm hoping that I can
        potentially allocate capital better than people who don't don't haven't ever like worked as
        an individual contributor on projects. So those are like my four main things going into the
        fall that I'm excited to continue working on. But then as with you and with everyone's like,
        there's so many other small things that like we all have to keep up with and help out with
        so
