        <span>Li Finance</span><br />
        Imagine a cross-chain 1inch— that’s Li Finance. Their thesis centres around providing instant liquidity with a next-gen UX by aggregating networks, DEXes and liquidity providers so that any to any swaps become as easy as it is to figure out that as collecting bags in a bull market. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text8}>
        And the best part is that Li Finance isn’t just available as a DAPP but also as a widget so that other DAPP devs can leverage the tool and keep their users on their respective platforms when engaging in swapping actions. Providing simplified and more user friendly tools and UIs is essential for scaling web3 to the average market participant, and the work from the Li Finance team is adding greater support to help get us there.

      <div className={styles.text9}>
        <span>Flashnft</span><br />
        Hot off the press as a derivative from the Loot Project, FlashNFT is building an NFT platform for the Loot community with freely available tools that will help users with more efficient token minting. The current version supports token ID queries, whereby users can query not yet minted token metadata and mint in batches to avoid wasting gas on already claimed items. Their plans for the future include multi-chain support and real time notification casting, as Loot expands out further into the broader web3 sphere. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text10}>
        <span>ROTKI</span><br />
        Rotki is an open source portfolio tracking and financial accounting tool. The unique part is that unlike almost all of its competing services where the use of closed source SaaS in the stack means that you are handing over your critical financial data to the company, with Rotki your data is encrypted and locally stored— no one but you needs to know the ins and outs of your PnL. Rotki started with a focus on more centralised exchanges, where the most volume and liquidity was, however, as DEXes have continued to take market share, they now include support for a lot of DeFi applications, including Sushiswap, AAVE, Curve and more. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text11}>
        <span>UPALA</span><br />
        Extremely fitting to the focus on identity for this issue of DIGIFIZZY, Upala is a Proof-of-PersonHood system that provides human uniqueness score to DApps and beyond. The score given represents how much financial cost, in $, it would take to forge the account. It’s an interesting concept and brings a unique flavor to how we validate good actors online, whereby group consensus and skin in the game through payments is leveraged to curate people and “explode” pools when malicious actors are found in the system.

        Have you ever wondered

      <div className={styles.text13}>
        how to keep up with that new project alpha like everyone else in the market? Ever wished that crypto had a native product hunt type dapp? 
        <br /><br />
        Well, Cryptotesters is here to help with all of your market and project discovery, navigation and validation needs! They are slowing transforming into a one stop shop for newcomers and curious web3 minds. But it’s not just a static interface, Cryptotesters is also assisting projects with their marketing, branding and communication, specifically to provide clear and simple messaging to those users that are still understanding more about  the space and sifting through the potential less well inclined projects for those that are truly building this new era. 
        <br /><br />
        Further, the Cryptotesters team is also putting together recommendation lists, basic “how tos”, community review tools and additional content such as blogs and podcasts. It won’t be long before they have enough building blocks to go full web3 and launch a project token for incentivising decentralised content curation and checks and balances on it.
