        I have a tiny bit of web dev experience (nothing professional) and experimented with python
        tutorials. I learned about a new language, Solidity, and heard from someone you could build
        permanent apps that don’t need to be running on your own server for anyone in the world to
        use at any time. This blew me away and I knew I had to learn more. I started with
        cryptozombies (which I still recommend any new people to Solidity and EThereum dev start
        with), and then just kept getting deeper and deeper slowly by building. The more I learned
        about crypto, the more obvious it has become that Ethereum is where new things really get
        built, and that is the most interesting part by far. The best way to learn is by doing.

        ELI5: There 1 giant pool of floor priced NFTs from various sets. Putting NFTs into the pool
        gives you varying amount of (erc20) FLOOR tokens that can be used anywhere in DeFi. Floor
        can be redeemed for any NFTs in the pool. The value of the NFTs in the pool is always at
        least 1:1 with FLOOR tokens value. NFTs have taught more people about crypto than any other
        type of product by several orders of magnitude. The dream is for NFT holders to learn about
        DeFi and all the cool financial tools that they have never had access to before. There are
        several protocols like NFT20 and NFTX that just scrape the surface of unlocking the value of
        NFTs for DeFi. However, each type of NFT gets its own pool, so the liquidity for each one is
        small & not enough to really do much with at the moment. Its obvious that there will be an
        AAVE like protocol a year from now when lending + yield on NFTs, there simply too much money
        on the table for there not to be. But we can’t build that without liquidity pools. I started
        DanceFloor (still a WIP) because I was tired of waiting for those other protocols to figure
        out how to increase usable liquidity dramatically. With DanceFloor’s “one big pool” design,
        instead of many smaller ones, I believe we can create a more effective pool to liquidate &
        efficiently trade bulk NFTs against, totally unlocking DeFi for them.

        If you’re buying floor priced assets, that is to say NFTs that are priced at the minimum
        price items in that set are going for, do you care which one you get? If you’re buying a
        bunch all at once at this minimum “Floor” price probably not. This is where the floor in
        Dance Floor comes from. #1 is bunchy protocol, I think they are most likely to become the
        “aave of NFTs”. But there are all kind of pawn shop, yield aggregating, options, and lending
        things you could build for NFTs if you have an effective deep liquidity pool to do
        liquidations against.

        I think its impossible to programatically decide whats a “good” type of NFT and not. That
        has to be decided by the community of users, who can judge for themselves. That where the
        DANCE token comes in. DANCE governs the protocol, and the community of holders decides what
        NFT types are allowed to be used in DanceFloor. At some point we will definitely rent out a
        night club in NYC and only DANCE holders in. On top of that… I’m not sure yet, theres a lot
        of ways the protocol could evolve from the early stage we are still at. I’m excited to see
        what other people come up with.

        The thing thats the most interesting to me is the permenance of it all. Humans have pretty
        much always clung to various kinds of collectables. But how many of those are simply lost to
        time? I think theres a serious chance many of the NFTs I own will exist longer than I will,
        and thats pretty cool to me.
