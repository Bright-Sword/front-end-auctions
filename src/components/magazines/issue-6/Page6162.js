        Plopski is a 19 year old Swedish-Spanish CSGO player and has already competed professionally
        in over 60 tournaments. He is currently playing for Ninjas in Pyjamas as a rifler. Plopski’s
        family history in gaming goes back to the roots, where his dad was previously also a CSGO
        player and has been his biggest supporter since, instilling a strong work ethic into
        Plopski, that is shown through his willingness to maintain as a student of the game and put
        in the hours necessary to improve his craft— killstreaks and more.

        CEB is all about Dota2, currently playing for OG. His professional career started all the
        way back in 2011, and over the length of his time in the spotlight he’s certainly
        experienced both the highs and lows of the industry; from the 2012 International collapse to
        reaching coach level at OG. His resiliance is a testament to all, as he continues to prove
        the haters wrong and remove all doubt that any of his skills have suffered decay.

        After a delayed launch, it’s safe to say that crypto x gaming is finally seeing the dawn of
        the recognition that it deserves. And casual gaming through Play-to-Earn models only
        scratches the surface of just how much value can be brought to the gaming industry through
        the direct connectivity of NFTs, DeFi and other crypto powered tools. Esports is another
        huge untapped sector for building wealth catalysts that can transform the entire top down
        approach that the current model is locked within— bridging stronger access channels so that
        any passionate player willing to put in the effort can have a fair shot at a player’s chair.

        Bybit crypto exchange is making further moves into the esports world, starting with
        partnerships with esports organizations Astralis and Alliance. Here, they plan to expand
        their player engagement strategy that are inclusive of financial education programs— esports
        yield farming might not be that far away.

        Motorsport Games and the Automobile Club de l’Ouest (ACO) have joined forces to launch the
        Le Mans Virtual Series with a $250,000 prize pool. It’s another bullish sign for the
        adoption of digital motorsports racing, where sponsors for the series include that of
        Goodyear, Thrustmaster, Rolex and Total Energies. Who knows when we will see F1 Monte Carlo
        racecd in VR, my bet is that it will be much sooner than one might initially expect. As more
        liquidity pours into virtual racing, more of us will start to recognise that immersives
        tracks don’t have a speed limit or set DRS zones.

        Team Singularity is expanding their partnership with Blocksport to develop an NFT

        Think a bit like NBA topshot but for esports— jersey skins, cards, pictures and in-game
        highlights. Onwards and upwards for new digital frontiers as more and more teams start
        navigating the web3 space; moving from groupie hype to properly incorporated decentralised
        front ends.
