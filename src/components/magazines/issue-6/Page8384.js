      <div className={styles.text2}>
        {' '}
        What gave the Loot community so much strength and growth velocity almost instantly? Is there
        some magic trick that other communities can emulate?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text3}>
        Everything moves so fast in crypto, how do you keep community momentum and engagement
        rising, which Loot was a perfect example of?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text4}>
        The community of builders in the Loot ecosystem is tight-knit and working to create a strong
        foundation. If there are new derivatives and other projects launching, that will be a rising
        tide that lifts all boats in the community (builders and the broader Loot community
        together).
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text5}>
        Why did you decide $AGLD? Does the come from a deep childhood experience with RPGs and
        gaming or was it something else?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text6}>
        I thought it was an interesting experiment to add an in-game currency to future Loot games.
        I used to run a game server many years ago, and I thought that a token with a fair launch to
        unify the community would be important.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text7}>
        How important is composability for a meta community? Like what we see with Loot, there is
        one big community, but then subsets of mini DAOs and builders everywhere.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text8}>
        Extremely important and the key to Loot's success. Without on-chain data and composability,
        we wouldn't see the depth of derivatives that we have.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text9}>
        Where does syndicate DAO fit with all of this? How important do you think it is for the
        tools for community building in web3 to evolve?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text10}>
        Syndicate DAO helps investing DAOs launch with best-in-class tokenomics and governance. We
        care deeply about building strong communities, and Loot is one of the examples of organic
        communities that can emerge in web3. Governance and tokenomics are still so early and we
        spend a lot of time at Syndicate developing best practices for the projects that we work
        with.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text11}>
        Where are the essential tools to build communities in web3? Where does anyone wanting to
        grow a community authentically start?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text12}>
        The most important factor is alignment on a community's goals. Usually these communities
        spin out of group chats, Discord servers, or existing projects. Having a group of people who
        are aligned from the start is extremely important.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text13}>
        You seem uniquely positioned to give insight on the tension between traditional VC investor
        money and direct to market web3 native sales and funding. How do these tensions get
        resolved?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text14}>
        I see it as similar to top-down vs bottom-up initiatives. VC is a fantastic way to fund a
        project on a multi-year timeline, if you know your strategy upfront. Direct to market web3
        sales are a great way to experiment and learn as you go. There is a role for both in the
        ecosystem. Syndicate is working on a timeline of many years, and VC allows us to think on a
        long-term timeline. The Loot community is much more experimental, where builders going
        directly to users makes more sense.

            The key lessons are:
            <br />
            1. Less is more.
            <br />
            2. Think carefully about tokenomics upfront.
            <br />
            3. On-chain composability is the future of NFTs.

      <div className={styles.text16}>
        so I came out of university, right as like, as social media was becoming a thing, and I'd
        run a small business for, to pay my way through university. And all sudden, like, social
        media, and Google and all these things are really hitting just blew my mind, like all of a
        sudden, this ability to have an audience and to run my own TV station or, you know, as a
        blogger back then, so be able to publish the world. So it was just this democratization of
        distribution was really exciting. And being sort of the front end, it became very clear,
        much earlier than most that, you know, Facebook or YouTube, or, you know, Twitter, kind of
        running the rails or owning the rails for which we rely on for our economic stability. And
        opportunity was just not an exciting thing. And so when I saw tokens in, like 2017, it just
        really, everything clicked for me this idea of being able to have an ownership stake in the
        networks that we're hoping to build and where we're creating a lot of the value through our
        network effects through participating. And so yeah, I got, I tried to, I bought my first
        Ethereum, so I could try to participate in in the Dow, but I wasn't technical enough to
        figure out how to actually do that, which was like, so good, ultimately, but that's laughing
        that day today. Yeah, and then 2017, early 2017, just fell down a rabbit hole, and ended up
        working on an early security token issuance for a fund, which was sort of like the wrong
        thing at the wrong time, and then worked through 2018 to 2019, on a couple different
        projects, all around this idea of turning collective contribution into sort of collectively
        on value. So this somewhat past summer 2020, had a few friends that Brian Flan and Alex
        massman, she has launched her on social tokens. And then Andrew Lee sort of launched the
        karma Dao social token. And it just became apparent to me that there was this new
        opportunity that was right in front of us, which is that, you know, communities on the
        internet could own themselves and could have their own assets and their own bank account.
        And it didn't even connected with the the broader idea of like, dows. At the time, it was
        just this much simpler. You know, if I hold on to X number of tokens, I get access to
        community, there's only so many tokens, and therefore I own a piece of the community. And I
        thought that was quite revolutionary. And so we dove in with two feet, trying to help answer
        the multitude of questions that come up when you start to think about what it looks like for
        a community to have their own cap table and bank account.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text17}>
        I think the missing piece there was that he didn't have a community he had an audience. And
        so truly what people are buying today, when you know it ranks for product market fit exists
        in the community, token world and the Dow world or social token world is people coming
        together to go on an adventure and hopefully change the the idea of this you know,
        multiplayer adventure that you're going on is key and if you look at a project like a cloud,
        like I don't see that happening there and so I'm not like or DSL or whatever we're calling
        it these days like I'm not the most bullish on that where I am bullish is on when looking at
        a chart here from shark down like these people are crazy they're like we're gonna go buy all
        the nouns are nouns auction and on the shark and it's just chaos in there and yet people are
        having a time that a lot like you'll constantly see people say this is the most fun I've
        ever had working ever and it's probably not even probably not getting paid for it right like
        or maybe they're earning some small amount tokens so I think that's the thing it's like we
        have an opportunity to go play multiplayer games and make money and have an impact and you
        know, absolutely if you don't have that as your core product in a tokenized community or
        token can be social tokens generally I think it's not going to work out so well.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text18}>
        I don't think it's necessary I think like the idea of coming together to create something is
        you know, can be the core promise I think if your promises included or we're actually gonna
        go you know, people should hold on to these tokens because the tokens will have value or
        increasing value then there's a an expectation there. This is frankly, I think almost a
        question I would turn to you because I think you've had a really interesting experience in
        putting a token out into the world and like do you feel like it's like have you lost
        momentum on on on your projects since the token because the token price went up quite a bit
        it's down quite a bit but my guess is there still a lot of people that are hyped on what
        you're building? the big difference to like in like launching when you guys did which was
        still in the early part of like this bull run I think even Yeah, I guess we'd call it Bull
        Run up but launching a token today like is even more crazy right like that. And so one of
        the things we work with so much in our projects is thinking through distribution and how and
        when to put a token out and I think it's so interesting that the most exciting most
        interesting token distributions were done in obscurity for the most part, like even I think
        even buying the powder pot. What am I? Yeah, like it was most people didn't remember people
        like sending the people in the middle like fuck is this? And that's like a great thing,
        right? Because most people can buy it at this time or like, or whether it's Fw B or Bitcoin
        or a crypto punk when somebody looked at it the first time they were like, Fuck this. This
        doesn't make any sense. But that allows for people to acquire it who actually truly believe
        in squiggles on the big squiggle guy gets me to the squiggles for three months, four months
        before it had any secondary value whatsoever now there's trading for $50,000 is like crazy.
        So I think like trying to launch something in this world right now it's Yeah, it'd be a lot
        more limited in who you try to get it because you're the wind man. I know it's maybe a bit
        of a tangent. No,
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text19}>
        we have to take a long term view on this, and I think probably one of the most amazing
        things with tokens and crypto is how early you get liquidity. And it's also one of the worst
        things where, you know, like, truly the value, you know, the value of most enterprises has
        created your 710 20. Right, like there's compounding benefits of holding and investing and
        reinvesting. And so I think we're playing way too many short term gains, short term,
        speculative gains. And so you know, for for people who are here, because they're on a
        mission, and they want to have an impact, they're trying to show headcase how creators can
        truly make a living and, and earn and do so and community, they're not so worried about the
        short term price fluctuations, at best will take advantage of them for, you know, good
        fundraising opportunities, etc. But they'll you know, what we suggest is really, a, we don't
        talk about price. B, we're taught, we talk about mission. And mission is the thing that we
        do, we'll do whether the price is up or the prices down. And that, you know, if price is
        down, then the true mission believers stay around. And it's an opportunity to really
        reconstitute and reform that core group. And so I think it is, right now there's just a lot
        of short term speculation. And yeah, the reality is, a lot of these things will go to zero
        or near to it. And why we are so excited about communities is because we believe that true
        communities will sustain regardless of whether there's, like exceptional returns in the near
        term, or, or not. And we can see an example of this even in like the last little while, like
        friends with benefits had, you know, a huge drawdown due to the hat, the roll hack that
        happened earlier this year. And for the longest time, which was trading far below what
        people had, like they just closed a private investment round. And it was trading far below
        that for months and months and months. And yet, there was no decrease in the number of
        people in that discord, there's only more excitement it was because there was this true
        sense of community and people were getting value through the interaction. And so that the
        fact that could sort of fall back on, you know, people like us do things like this, and the
        things like this is some sort of mission or adventure that we're on that I think the price
        matters a lot less than if we believe that web three is the big transformative, you know,
        shift, but I think many of us do, then. And if you've been around, or at least have people
        around you who have been around since 2014, or 2017, and you recognize that there will be a
        lot of draw downs. And that's just part of the game. And if you stick with it, then the
        opportunities just multiply. That's my long winded rant, of all the things I would say to
        somebody like that. No, I just can't like, people are just sleeping on how big a fucking
        opportunity this is, frankly. And so you're thinking about, I gotta get mine and you know,
        you're looking 10 feet in front of you. And there's 10 years that we're going down. And, you
        know, like the sure there's going to be probably whether your token or not that you've
        launched is worth something, the feeling of A plus talk to you, whether your token or not is
        worth anything, the future, the value that you and your community are co creating, just
        through the act of practicing how to actually innovating and just being a part of this world
        is it's not going anywhere. And the only way it's going to go somewhere is if you play short
        term games and do something stupid that you know, is counterproductive to being a good human
        being.
