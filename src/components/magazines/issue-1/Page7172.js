        GDP per capita ranking is no longer the gold standard of economic prosperity that we've all
        been led to believe it was. Instead, a population's well-being is just as important,
        particularly within the context of global crises that worsen economic inequality.

        The metaverse, and gaming in general, are increasingly demonstrating their actual value as
        the digitalization of society accelerates. New, disruptive, and decentralized technologies
        are being developed at light speed, granting user agency on a scale that's never been seen
        before. The metaverse economy is constantly expanding as eye-watering sums of money are
        passed around like hot potatoes. We're seeing a shift towards individuals taking full
        ownership of their digital identities and controlling them as they move through their
        bespoke customer journeys interacting with the brands they choose while strengthening social
        bonds between fellow gamers and digital citizens. Creators, artists, designers, and
        visionary startups are finally getting their due as harbingers of a new era thanks to the
        metaverse.

        Moreover, as the lines blur between the physical and the digital planes of existence, the
        opportunities remain as tantalizing and limitless for creators of all persuasions as more
        companies involve themselves in the emergent metaverse, all seeking to get their piece of
        the pie (and digital real estate) on which to advertise, create, innovate, and explore.

        While McGonigal stated that reality was "broken" because it lacks the ability to engage or
        motivate meaningful action as games do (in the negative context of the word), the metaverse
        can be defined as "broken" within the context of an exceedingly over-powered or downright
        degenerate Magic: the Gathering card because its powers are so immense, and its impact can
        be world-changing.
        <br />
        <br />
        It's astounding to think that there are still individuals who feel the metaverse — and
        gaming, for that matter — exists solely for the purpose of tuning in, turning on, and
        dropping out. But the truth is, gaming is so much more than just hedonistic pleasure. Gaming
        has always been about creating a sense of identity and belonging to a tightly-knit
        community. It's all just a matter of putting it all together and leveraging the unbridled
        optimism, productivity, and creativity — as well as an epic win condition — to make real,
        tangible, and long-lasting change, regardless of what plane of existence it is pursued on,
        physical or digital notwithstanding.

        The modding community is the backbone to the gaming and esports industries. The modders have
        built the castles for the OG game content that so many of us identify with, supporting
        increasingly novel content for building avid player bases and die hard fans. The community
        is heavily undervalued, unseen.
