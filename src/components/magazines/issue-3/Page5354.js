DeFi, like blockchain technology, has no shortage of evangelists willing to promote to anyone who would listen about how it redefines finance under the principles that underpin blockchain technology. 
<br/><br/>
However, as with any fast-growing sector and developing technology, it has its own set of detractors, critics, risks, and uncertainties, as evidenced by the numerous cases of rugpulls, scams, governance dramas, and other colossal failures in the DeFi space (just as the Mark Cuban/Titan Finance debacle recently proved.)
<br/><br/>
Therefore, it’s not just the participants who need to be onboarded on a rational understanding of the possibilities, numerous opportunities, problems, and pitfalls, but also the entirety of industry and government alike. 
<br/><br/>
There’s no question that massive amounts of capital are flowing into numerous DeFi protocols—but the industry remains volatile as ever. However, much of the activity has been centered on yield generation, speculation, and leverage. Moreover, the programmability, immutability, and interoperability that DeFi services offer also have their share of new and untested risks.
<br/><br/>
DeFi will ultimately sink or swim on the basis of achieving its full, unbridled potential. And its potential benefits can’t have arrived at a better time than now—in a world fraught with black swans, precariously teetering on the brink of existence. It’s all going to be a matter of adoption and the ongoing process of mitigating risk.
<br/><br/>
Conclusion<br/>
We’re past the point of hype. The quantum leaps and bounds we see in finance as driven by crypto are but a little taste of what’s possible as far as money’s function is concerned. Yes, the DeFi space is fledgling, with plenty of lost time to make up against legacy financial services and technology. But the possibility of how radically finance can be transformed when anyone with a modicum of coding knowledge can freely participate in building their own solution in the coming years is a future so tantalizing it’s worth paying to see.

Today I am very excited about Non-Fungible Tokens that can be made by myself and literally carry my traits around as a kind of rich information like DNA and at any time I can organize a collection and make these gems available for other digital hunters. I'm feeling so ready for this"</p>

Captain America's pink shield is a really special item as it was the key for me to start making 3D. That was my first object made in blender. So many great memories!</p>

This texture, appearance and colors were accidentally replaced. Glad that the final render stayed and I am very happy to have him now as a non-fungible token, he deserves this place.</p>
