      <p className={styles.text2}>A Deeper Dive into DeFi</p>  
      <p className={styles.text3}>Fads are collective behaviors shaped within a social group that exaggeratedly, zealously follows them for a short timeframe. Such behaviors come and go, just as the tide ebbs and flows along the coastline, and as fast as it happens. Blink and you’ll miss it—once the sheen comes off, fads fade into the annals of history.
<br/><br/>
Hype, on the other hand, is simply marketing. To paraphrase from Fellini, it’s the desperate attempt of an artist to convince journalists that what they made is worth the ordeal of having to review it. 
<br/><br/>
Trends, on the other hand, are prevailing tendencies or inclinations as to where a situation is going, or in the way people are behaving. Trends manifest themselves in observable manners across history, culture, society, economics, finance, and technology—and they gain more power as they grow over time. That’s because trends create a domino effect the more individuals commit to engaging in them, regardless of where they develop—rather than the ephemera that fads ultimately are.
<br/><br/>
Well, one of the trends is emerging in finance—itself a traditionally highly-centralized sector whose centralization was thought to be beneficial to maintain the stability of complex, intertwined global financial markets. 
<br/><br/>
And, thanks to the possibilities offered by the technological adroitness of the blockchain, paired with increasing cryptocurrency adoption (and unprecedented media mileage) has turned the gilded gates of traditional finance inside out. This gave birth to a truly borderless and open finance revolution spearheaded by the framework known as decentralized finance (DeFi).
<br/><br/>
DeFi is a hotbed of disruption sitting smack dab in the middle of the blockchain, digital assets, and finance. And its underlying protocols have disrupted financial technology by offering a mix of familiar and novel services hitherto untapped by the global population. 
<br/><br/>
Decentralized applications, or Dapps, allow individuals to access financial services running the gamut of finance, such as payments, investments, credit, and insurance, among many others, mainly on the Ethereum blockchain settlement layer through smart contracts. Smart contracts allow developers to bake in sophisticated features going above and beyond sending and receiving cryptocurrencies.
<br/><br/>
Between September 2017 and the time of this writing, the total value of cryptocurrencies locked up in DeFi protocols stood from about US$4 million to an eye-watering US$51.9 billion. The DeFi market peaked at a high of US$88.4 billion during its zenith last May 2021. The numbers are staggering—but we’ve yet to scratch the tip of the iceberg.
<br/><br/>
From decentralized exchanges, credit, insurance, to the unprecedented NFT boom, DeFi has become a buzzword because of the possibilities, and it’s not surprising that it’s in the middle of every crypto-related conversation.
<br/><br/>
Even as the dust settles, and the ecstatic, yet illogical exuberance wears off, and the afterglow remains. But the reality is here: DeFi is here to stay, and an actual, ridiculously lucrative industry has essentially passed the acid test of viability, traction, and sustainability. 
<br/><br/>
In essence, we’re at the crossroads of transitioning from hype to reality—as DeFi continues its disruption across the financial services industry.</p>
