      <p className={styles.text1}>Anna was born in the Soviet Union a year after the collapse and grew up in a middle-class family in Odessa, Ukraine.  Her mother, who was from Siberia, met her father in Ukraine where they fell in love and decided to live on the Black Sea. Odessa is a wonderful place to grow up. The kind of place where you can experience all 4 seasons, eat organic fruits and vegetables, breathe healing air and enjoy the Black Sea vibes.  Anna’s childhood was filled with creation and activities, and almost every summer she visited her grandparents in a Siberian village, where she learned some of the world’s wonders and the alchemy of connection with her Soul. <br/>
   At four years of age Anna created her first conscious self portrait.  “I will always remember how I painted my first conscious portrait sitting in front of the mirror for several hours without stopping. I remember I was wearing pink earrings with ruby and green flannel shirt.  Sleepy eyes with disheveled hair.  I was serious and a focused child who accepted herself without embellishment, true herself at the moment.”  (Art Photo)<br/>
  When she turned six she went to after school art classes “ART studios” with amazing God gifted teacher Maya Arsentievna. Here she studied all different art crafts and participated many drawing contests.  Later in life receiving a bachelor and master degree from Odessa State Academy of Civil Engineering and Architecture. This educational experience opened her potential in structuring and programming where she was then able to integrate it into the art creation process.   Her favorite disciplines were academic art,  building design, and ecology. Her diploma work was focused on bionic architecture, ergonomics, ecology, and urbanism.  This allowed her to integrate the beauty of good urbanism within her city life, and to receive honors degree awards at competitions.<br/>
  After her graduate studies she worked three years in an architectural firm.  Anna soon realized that institutional work was not pulling out her best qualities as an artist.  After her architectural career she collaborated for two years with well known Ukrainian sculptor, practiced tattooing, and freelanced. Before moving to her California dream destination she traveled around the world focusing on transformation and spiritual growth, traveling to India, Thailand, Bali, Spain, Italy, and Bulgaria. <br/>
   After her transformation and spiritual journey she found a power jump into big world of Art.  Traveling by herself, while learning English, she moved to California and surrendered to the process. Here she has found a true happiness living the Northern Cali lifestyle. Through the thorny path of the artist she is full of faith to make ArtRevolution and turn our beautiful world into better place. <br/>
 Living through a heart she transmits divine light into her Art.  <br/>
