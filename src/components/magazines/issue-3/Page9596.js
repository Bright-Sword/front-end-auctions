      <p className={styles.text11}>My most go-to resources are Pinterest, Unsplash, Wired, National Geographic, Google Scholar, NASA, and many more. I usually gather much more visuals than in the final example you see in the mood board below. Every time I look at the board, I keep deleting the images that seem repetitive or out of place. It is not an exact science, but it helps to keep focused. To my </p> 
      <p className={styles.text12}>students, I usually said they are not supposed to use more than 6 images and 5 colors. Additionally, I told them to refrain from putting smartphone designs in a mood board to design a smartphone. It is often not as inspiring and can lead to accidental copying. I find textures and non-related imagery often unlocking more creativity than the same object you aspire to design.</p>

<br/>Good design is thorough down to the last detail
