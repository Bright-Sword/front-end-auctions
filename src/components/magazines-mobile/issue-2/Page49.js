        What’s the overall sentiment towards cryptoart and blockchain on the island? It sounds like
        it’s been somewhat mixed.
        <br />
        <br />
        It’s bad for the most part. That’s because the first waves of crypto people that have come
        to the island made a lot of missteps and burned bridges right from the start. Many Puerto
        Ricans take it personally and blame the technology for the failings of specific groups of
        people. We see this outside of Puerto Rico also, where very unappealing behavior from
        Bitcoin maxis, DeFi degens, or scammers and shillers of the latest fad coin will give a bad
        impression to the much larger market of people who don’t yet understand how radical,
        revolutionary, and uplifting technologies like Ethereum, NFTs and DAOs have been.
        <br />
        <br />
        One Latin American crypto artist I follow, @PXhita put it very well recently:
        <br />
        <br />
        “Today I did the math of how much was my salary in eth as a waitress in Argentina before
        finding cryptoart.
        <br />
        <br />
        It was 0.061 eth a month.
        <br />
        <br />
        So I ask myself:
        <br />
        How can cryptoart die if it is a revolution that empowers small creators, artists and
        curious minds around the world?”

          Like you said, Puerto Ricans have overcome a lot — Hurricane Maria, earthquakes, debt
          crisis, political crisis, the pandemic — and still face many challenges. Do you think NFTs
          can help? How?
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        We cannot wait for outside help. We always have to think and move fast, to survive. NFTs are
        the first thing in my life to really deliver on the promise of more than wealth to support
        creative freedom, but real power and independence in our lives. As Puerto Ricans, we’ve
        needed that for so long it can be hard to believe it is here now. Cryptoart and everything
        else that is coming up thanks to NFTs are already changing how we see ourselves and put food
        on our tables. They are empowering us to teach each other how to build a better future for
        the island, the diaspora, and to be a model for others.

      <div className={styles.text3}>
        <div className={styles.title}>
          What about the creative economy and web3 in general? What do they mean for the future of
          the island?
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        It’s the same. What I talk about in my art, what NFTs give us power and hope to do, and what
        decentralization means for creators… It’s all the same.
        <br />
        <br />
        Marginalized fragments, sometimes very hostile to each other, or rooted in deep personal and
        historical traumas, finding a way to come together, rise up, and transform into something
        better. Nothing is guaranteed and the deck is stacked against us, and yet all of this beauty
        and wealth is being spread by people who never would have gotten a shot before. It all tells
        me that the future for the island and anyone else who wants to learn from the lessons we’ve
        lived, will continue to be hard but also far more rewarding than it’s even been before.
