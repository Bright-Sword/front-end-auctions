        attaining more strengthened cyclical upturns. Hence, as one can imagine, when investors show
        up to the island purely in furtherance of their own self interest, it turns out to be
        undeniably destructive to the commons, whether they realise it or not. And, unfortunately,
        more often than not, crypto holders have been associated with engaging in this kind of
        endeavor.

        It is a shame really where the current perception of the locals about the web3 community
        stands, and also the lack of more coherent initiative by the broader crypto sphere to truly
        take the time in understanding and appreciating how and why PR is such a focal essentiality
        in further expanding a decentralised creative economy powered by NFTs, crypto, DAOs etc.

        Puerto Rico is a microcosm of an economy that is extremely well positioned for embedding
        creativity as a positive function of society, where creative vitality can empower and
        promote a multi-generational workforce to new sustainable means that are directly stimulated
        by the progression, adoption and eventual global changeover to a web3 enabled creative
        economy— a community that although can be very much seeded and well formed in Puerto Rico,
        broadcasts huge gains and benefits globally. And this is where the tax structure combined
        with the island’s focus on boosting a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem through additional
        resource allocation and grants, can actually be used for the benefit of supporting and
        protecting the commons; creating low barriers to entry for opportunity, talent discovery and
        genuine breakthroughs, as the development and usage of creative production tools across the
        full spectrum of application capacity can be established from PR to foster not only their
        own local talent, but also attract and inspire other creatives, technologists, entrepreneurs
        to the region to partake in this new ecosystem; from digital fashion, to web3 immersive
        realms, to a crypto powered economy.

        The capacity to do it the right way and combine the beneficial local economic incentives
        with a truly thriving tech enabled ecosystem is not an impossible feat. In fact, if we
        really all are serious about overturning the legacy models and clearing wider paths for the
        masses to be able to quickly download and access the dexterity required to successfully gain
        from web3, then it’s necessary. Whether a DAO or an individual, the beginnings are for the
        taking.
