      <p className={styles.text3}>9EN3TRIX derived from a Latin word “Genetrix” - She that produces, a mother (A Latin Dictionary. Founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary. revised, enlarged, and in great part rewritten by. Charlton T. Lewis, Ph.D. and. Charles Short, LL.D. Oxford. Clarendon Press. 1879). The title of the project has been inspired by the notion of “Gaia Paradigm” - a hypothesis suggesting the unification of all living in the biosphere. In ancient history it was believed that if such an entity really exists and possesses self-awareness it might well have taken on the role of mother – Gaia (Aegean and Anatolian cultures), Genetrix (Greek mythology), Umai (Turkic cultures). </p>
