        These NFTs can be programmable, tradable, interoperable and composable. This composable
        approach towards fashion, verified by the blockchain, is a major leap in digital materials
        and design ownership, digital supply chain management, process automation, efficacy
        management.

        FGO is built native to web3— where both the Ethereum blockchain and Polygon Network are
        leveraged for the minting and issuance of each 1155 NFT. Polygon ensures that the minted
        NFTs are in check with the broader revolution of what digital fashion enables— a more
        efficiently sustainable supply chain and fashion industry.

        FGO also promotes the broader mission for enabling gatemakers of the metaverse. Modding the
        Metaverse. The metaverse is nothing more than a radical reduction in the barriers between
        us. As these barriers come down, as the gates minaturise, the friction that might stop us
        normally from any given choice dissipates, allowing for new modes of interaction that are
        inherently fluid and liberating. And, with that said, modding is the fundamental practice
        that drives growth and change in fashion, gaming, mechanics… everything. The methodology
        behind modding and the byproducts that come from it are what actually build the metaverse.
        And, not just build the metaverse but also ensure that it will be kept open, vital and
        continuously unique to each personal experience.

        Fractional Garment Ownership is an immediate first step towards reinforcing the ground roots
        growth and authenticity of our ecosystem to be comprehensively responsive to the commons
        from the most modular, composable and programmable level — the pattern, material and texture
        level — as the building blocks for streamlining an entirely on-chain and open source supply
        chain that can be scaled across both the digital and physical realms; underpinned by ERC
        protocol standards (1155, 721, 998). Open is important, because this time around we must do
        it right.
