        Though I don't have a huge background in gaming, I am fascinated with the concept of the
        virtual world-- especially one that is more than just a game. Virtual worlds for commerce,
        art, and education are particularly interesting to me and areas that I will dedicate myself
        to building. I have spent a lot of time conceptualizing a Metaverse platform / ecosystem
        based around the 3D city prototype I had built out, one that is particularly focused on 3D
        fashion. In short, the virtual world is a social-commerce platform to support the
        interoperable digital fashion ecosystem. This project which I call XENOTECH is a culmination
        of all the creative work I have done thus far, and I am actively looking for resources and
        guidance and team members to help me build out this vision.

        As I mentioned, the primary source of inspiration for my work has been an international
        upbringing and traveling. Particularly, Japan and India have been two of the most impactful
        places I have visited. Collecting is also a defining passion and inspiration. I went through
        an endless list of collecting obsessions including physical things like bottle caps, rubix
        cubes, trading cards (especially Yu-Gi-Oh!), Webkinz, stamps, coins, chess boards,
        gemstones, souvenirs, dvds, and books, and digital things like minecraft items, as well as
        keeping track of every movie and book I've consumed, and logging my daily routines as a
        collection of my experiences. So naturally, finding out about NFTs has been a defining
        moment. On the creative side, other notable sources of inspiration include filmmaker Gasper
        Noe and his film Enter the Void, as well as the ambient album “新しい日の誕生(birth of a new
        day)” by 2814. Most recently the book “The Sleepwalkers” by Arthur Koestler has served as a
        huge inspiration in my recent work and perspective as an artist. The book provides
        fascinating insight into the creative mind, particularly through a lens of the history of
        astronomy, following the story of all the notable astronomers including Copernicus, Kepler,
        and Tycho Brahe to name a few. These insights have really solidified my appreciation for the
        intersections between art and science.
