        the concerns or costs, and in fact, if you speak with an authentic community member they
        will be more than open to discussing the topic in all of its glory. There are 4-5 years of
        documented discussions, conferences, deep academic research, and github repositories all on
        this topic. Ethereum is currently in the live process of migrating to Ethereum 2.0 and Proof
        of Stake as a huge environmentally conscious step as the mechanism for securing the network
        becomes far more energy efficient.

        Bitcoin, unlike Ethereum, for now, and most probably as long as it continues to operate, is
        sticking with Proof of Work. However, not all of Bitcoin’s energy consumption translates
        into the high
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text2}>
        carbon emissions that is so often misrepresented. Much of Bitcoin’s mining uses renewable
        energy, and, although the exact % of mining leveraging this is not precisely accounted for,
        it sits somewhere between 39%-70%— which, case in point, is in itself higher than the
        renewable energy in the US power grid. Miners in China also have taken the same initiative,
        where a considerable amount use excess energy that would otherwise be wasted in those areas
        where it can not be exported to city infrastructure.

      <div className={styles.text3}>
        Thus, with this said, and taking a step back to look at the bigger picture, perhaps there is
        a way after all that Bitcoin can continue to operate and actually help take advantage of
        much more wasted energy than previously thought. Even El Salvador and the presidents recent
        announcement to enact Bitcoin as legal tender has been announced alongside the country’s
        intention to put up a plan to offer facilities for Bitcoin mining with considerably cheap
        and 100% renewable 0 emissions energy from their volcanos.

        It’s consumption shouldn’t be ignored and more active and collective steps must be taken,
        however, perhaps after all, all of the contraversy isn’t so much just solely about the
        environment. It’s moreso about people being scared of a new revolutionary technology and not
        taking the proper time, that is required, to fully understand it in all of its complicity.
        <br />
        <br />
        It’s important that we do not mistake the forest for the trees— the situation is not black
        and white. Bitcoin is so much more than just an energy expenditure. It is the first globally
        recognised censorship-resistant decentralised digital asset that has ultimately initiated
        the entirity of the web3 ecosystem as we know of it today— an ecosystem that provides
        tangible evidence that the broken centralised web2 exploitation is not a framework that any
        of us have to accept or be forced to live by.
