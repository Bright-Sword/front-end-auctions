        Communities have their own intrinsic existential reasons, motivations, and order amidst the
        chaos, and not all of them can be tokenized and measured. If shareholder return is the
        ultimate value we ascribe to in DAOs, and make that the sole barometer with which we
        determine the success or failure of a DAO, what use do we have for its inherently
        democratic, fair, autonomous, and decentralized nature? What’s good for the goose may not
        necessarily be good for the gander as what makes good financial sense doesn’t necessarily
        mean good organizational relationships.
        <br />
        <br />
        There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution, but perhaps one lies in creating an appropriate
        token distribution aligned to what a particular community is trying to achieve. Some
        communities might benefit from more decentralization, some might benefit from less.
        Concentrating tokenomics to the founders and earliest members might be an effective way to
        inculcate and preserve the values that they are espousing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Organized chaos isn’t a solution either. Leaders matter in a world where lines are
        increasingly blurring between communities - and like politics, hierarchy cannot be done away
        with. Effective DAOs have strong missions and visions that are aligned with milestones that
        ensure progress is actually being made.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the end, communities that are able to build a tribe and cementing the values that they
        espouse can harness the power of DAOs and their underlying tokenization: organizations with
        truly massive, global, and agile scale, extremely low operational costs, fully-aligned
        milestones, incentives, and motivations to pursue a shared and deeply-ingrained mission and
        vision whose common denominator is to provide value across every endpoint in the ecosystem.
        The key is to constantly test and experiment things, but not to the point of breaking them —
        the mistakes that led to the forking of Ethereum in 2016 still sting to this very day.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin perhaps said it best when vast resources of capital cannot
        compete with a project with “soul.” As DAOs rise up as the next big blockchain trend,
        maintaining a balance between both will be quite the highwire act — but those that master it
        will harness the true power that DAOs possess.
        <br />
        <br />
        For what shall it profit a community, if it shall gain the whole world, but lose its soul?
        <br />
        <br />
        Food for thought.
