      <p className={styles.text1}>In essence, we're seeing the fruits of the disenfranchisement that many of us have seen, heard, felt, or lived through as the technology manifests. Crypto is a rejection of the fractional banking system as we know it. NFTs settle the question of how creators have been forever commodified by Web2 platforms as well as ownership and royalties. DeFi is a rejection of the money-grubbing shysters in Wall Street. Meanwhile, DAOs are thriving as the precariousness on which our economic lives hang in the balance and as more individuals understand the value of moving away from anachronic and inefficient centralized governance, management, and unfair compensation structures. DAOs allow communities to allocate capital for their collective benefit — which is exactly why DAOs will become a hot topic in crypto in the coming months, demonstrating their value in a world where the only constant thing is change.
<br/><br/>
Time will tell if more individuals adopt Web3 as a hedge. But it's clear that the benefits are enticing because they are 1) driven and governed by the community, 2) secure and robust, and 3) provide a fair share of the economic benefits for everyone in the value chain. Of course, it's all just a matter of time before they outperform the old paradigm of Web2 and redefine the global economy. But until then, they make a pretty great hedge. 
<br/><br/>
These technologies are the silver lining to the nebulous precarity brought on by Web2-style centralization and gatekeeping — but as the Grateful Dead song goes, "Every silver lining's got a touch of grey." Granted, the existence of Web3 and blockchain technologies doesn't mean the problem is already solved. While blockchain technology and all the good things it brings with it have immense potential to disrupt the world into decentralization, in the end, it's always values that communities and technologies deliver on. Only fools worship their tools. Think about it.
