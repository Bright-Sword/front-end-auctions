      <p className={styles.text1 }>The Token Utility RugPull</p>
      <p className={styles.text2 }>The appeal of web3 is very much centered around the promise of having our current economy and global systems operate in a decentralised commercial environment where the chokepoints for value exchange are no longer chokepoints; rather, they are generative and circulatory exchange sites that anyone with a web3 enabled device has access to both interact with, gain value from, and leverage off of in a way that doesn’t destroy the commons. However, the version of web3 that we have today still isn’t quite there yet— it’s more like a web2.5-2.8. 
<br/><br/>
An ecosystem with as big of an undertaking as this takes time to evolve, and it’s impossible to authentically achieve overnight, but, in many cases that reasoning isn’t enough to compensate for the fact that better across so many verticals is readily available right now. It’s just that some of us aren’t ready to let go of a system that has incentivised us to act in a way that is exploitative of the commons.  </p>
      <p className={styles.text3 }>The principles of what web3 stands for are violated when it’s just another get rich quick scheme or capital shell game for gatekeepers. And this is what is still happening today; especially in regards to early stage companies entering and building in the space and the all to comfortably accepted mindset and roadmap of them coming in and purely “building for an exit”.  
<br/><br/>
It might sound like a bit of a catch 22, where funding is usually a consistent challenge, at least initially, that many startups face, and in the web2 era, overcoming that challenge involves a lot of meetings, calls and persuasive dialogues with VCs, Angel investors, or whatever other name given to those that hand over capital to a company/team in exchange for equity or stake in that project (and often a pretty large portion of it). 
<br/><br/>
This model does make sense— it’s a give and take where the investor is putting skin in the game early on, when the risk is usually the highest, in the hope that their clever judgement and ability to spot winners pays off, earning them massively positive convexity on that initial investment. 
<br/><br/>
However, this model in its vanilla web2 form is counter to what is required to build out an authentic project in crypto, NFTs, web3 etc. The mechanistic backdrop behind the model of an investor, or anyone, taking on the risk at the most uncertain stage thus warranting them the highest reward correctly weighs out the incentives, however, where it breaks down is the thinking that in a web3 environment structuring token allocations for the explicit benefit of VCs, the internal team, and those purely entering for the </p>
      <p className={styles.text4 }>exits reinforces openness, decentralisation, distributed access... because it doesn’t. Instead, it just perpetuates the existing model for web2 gatekeepers to start building walls and deciding who fits in where before anything has even really begun. And since better is so clearly available now it is an intentionally harmful choice. To pretend that it is the better thing whilst it is just making money for its own sake with the old methods is the epitome of the Red Queen and her servants in the race. Maintaining a rigged system where to simply keep your position you have to run twice as fast.
      <br/><br/>
We all have the opportunity to do it right this time, to exemplify the reasons why web3, decentralisation, DeFi, NFTs and the Metaverse exist; changing for the better the precarious reality lived by all who still need permission from some 3rd party for basic and vital choices in our lives. And for those of us that have chosen to build infrastructure and protocols in this space we must take on the responsibility to do it right. Coming into this space for the exit is not ok. It’s not to say that there is something wrong with wanting to  make money through novel mechanisms for its own sake, but within the systems of the world that we live in today, that is no longer an ethical position to take. As important as it is to make money, if the only reason you are here is to make money then this is not the right place for you. We are here to build out the infrastructure needed to entirely replace existing extractive economic models. Whether you believe that is possible, we do.</p>
