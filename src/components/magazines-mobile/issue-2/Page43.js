          <b>Token Value and DAO Structure Optimization: The Common Denominator</b>
        </i>
        <br />
        The core commonality for all DAO token members is the all-encompassing desire to optimize
        the structure as well as token value. Suppose a member identifies an optimization that
        generates value to token holders. In that case, it is more than enough incentive for members
        to perform them, because it is in their interest to do so.
        <br />
        <br />
        Members can then submit proposals to optimize voting procedures, improve virtual assets,
        increase marketing, etc., explaining concrete steps on what actions to take and how such
        actions will generate value for the community. Therefore, performance assessment relies
        solely on optimizing value rather than whose boot you lick or your politesse. DAOs don't
        discriminate between performance measures — the bottom line is fair remuneration for good
        performance. Not your college background or lack thereof, or the lack of a string of
        acronyms and certifications to the end of your name just to feel good about yourself. As a
        result, DAOs are more democratic than any other iteration of a centralized organizational
        structure in, say, a private company. Everyone has a say in how a protocol develops, and
        everyone truly gets the organization they deserve. That's a far cry from having all that
        power, influence, and direction vested in a council or board of directors who can
        unilaterally and arbitrarily determine the yardstick of value in an organization, leading to
        wasted time and resources on endless and unproductive Zoom meetings and processes that
        impede rather than optimize.
        <br />
        <br />
        DAOs, in the final analysis, are driven by value, and so are their governance and workflows.
        This emphasis on generating value optimizes workflow processes and offers sustainable
        solutions to challenges faced by DAO token holders. In DAOs, only a token holder's
        contributions will determine the influence and outcomes of their endeavors. Nothing else.
        And that's what makes them so revolutionary — by their focus on value to effort workflows.
        <br />
        <br />
        Furthermore, all the regulatory bloat that comes with solving the corporate governance
        problems related to shareholders and management is no longer needed. DAOs require less
        supervision, and management constraints are a thing of the past because there are no
        supervisors in a DAO. It all boils down to the token holders advancing the organization's
        interest according to their unique backgrounds and skills, and the incentivization to create
        value based on skill and beliefs, rather than what the powers that be dictate — paving the
        way to a more equitable, fairer society.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>
          <b>Existential Hazards</b>
        </i>
        <br />
        There’s no question about how the potential for DAOs are picking up steam as the world
        recognizes that monetary systems require better governance. DAOs are poised to be the next
        big thing in the blockchain space because of their potential to solve governance problems
        that have been around since time immemorial. But gaps remain, and they are exemplified by
        how some DAOs fall by the wayside and eventually abandoned, when blockchains fork (THE DAO
        debacle leading to the forking of Ethereum in 2016 comes to mind), and when members simply
        quit. Why?
      </div>

      <div className={styles.text2}>
        For all the promise that they bring, DAOs, as of yet, are just starting to scratch the
        surface of finding its elusive product-market fit, or the degree to which a product
        satisfies a particular demand. And much of this lies on a disproportionate focus on making a
        profit.
        <br />
        <br />
        There’s no question that DAOs and the increasing number of communities using tokens can
        potentially be a world-changing paradigm shift waiting to happen. But the pitfalls are real,
        and serious questions must be asked if the space is to evolve.
        <br />
        <br />
        There’s no doubt that tokenization has a ton of benefits. But that doesn’t necessarily mean
        members’ incentives and goals are aligned. Who benefits when an issuer creates no value for
        token holders, or when token holders create no value for an issuer? What, then, incentivizes
        individuals to buy into it apart from speculation?
        <br />
        <br />
        Tokenization has the potential to inject a toxic mindset of profiteering into every
        organization, which can supersede every other non-financial incentive. Communities evolve
        into a network hell-bent on maximizing the bottom line at the expense of brotherhood and
        solidarity, which are thrown out the window in favor of economic self-interest and selfish
        attitudes. It happens everywhere.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tokenized communities can be the most value-driven & effective organizations we’ve ever had.
        To realize that we need to be extremely intentional about ‘social capital.’ Representing it
        too much like financial capital may erode its power rather than capture leverage &
        influence.
