        The world is building towards antifragility in the face of black swans. Passé hierarchical
        structures that concentrate power and influence within the hands of centralized bodies and
        are controlled by a select few in every facet of human industry are being exposed for the
        fragile things they are. And people are tired of having to deal with that gatekeeping
        bullshit in everything they do. The black swan of COVID-19 just accelerated everything into
        overdrive. We demand agency, we demand control, we demand transparency— and damn it, we want
        it now. Fragile systems will perish.
        <br />
        <br />
        One thing's for sure: he who controls the distribution controls the narrative. Facebook,
        Apple, Google, and their ilk have become the new gatekeepers of the Web2 we've all come to
        know, love, and eventually loathe for their brazen rent-seeking, arbitrary and unchecked
        rule-making power to silence free speech. Twitter tried to censor who was then the world's
        most powerful man. Apple and Google unilaterally control what can and can't go on their
        respective app stores. Influencers stepping out of the party line will receive a visit from
        the YouTube thought police — and de-platformed if need be. Mark Zuckerberg can just sell
        your data to the next corporate scumbag. No one man should have all that power. Or entity,
        for that matter. Democratization creates dictators — who would've known? They're everywhere,
        and they've taken over the institutions — banking, technology, finance, you name it, there's
        going to be a group of pesky gatekeepers wanting to stick their finger in as many pies as
        they possibly can.
        <br />
        <br />
        The emergence of Web3 and the metaverse — which is constantly building towards inherently
        antifragile, decentralized systems — is the antidote to the toxic culture of gatekeeping. As
        a result, massive streams of heretofore untapped (and seriously restrained) human creativity
        are pouring into Web3 to deliver what the internet promised while enabling everyone to
        participate in generating value. This is opposed to the top-heavy hierarchies that dominate
        Web2 and the rest of the world's industries (banking, finance, fashion, etc.), locking the
        value and power amongst the elites in a hitherto perpetual stranglehold to exploit as much
        value as possible.
        <br />
        <br />
        The die is cast, and increasing numbers of individuals moving into the metaverse for the
        majority of their work, play, education, and creativity is happening as it did in the
        halcyon days of the internet, when everything was new and shiny, and where community, not
        corporate greed and rent-seeking gatekeeping, drove innovation. Nothing stands in the way of
        that happening despite the major challenges that Web3 faces as far as adoption and
        onboarding are concerned. Its antifragility is evident as we see the decentralized processes
        and systems constantly being built to support its inevitable growth, despite the volatile,
        unpredictable black swan events threatening its very existence.
