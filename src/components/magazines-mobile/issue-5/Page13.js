        conventional marketplace formats we’ve all grown accustomed to by bringing in a virtualization layer for the physical shopping experience. It’s representative of the shift from Amazon and eBay, redefining the buyer-seller dynamic by implementing web3 technology to facilitate efficiency, convenience, and decentralisation. The emergence of virtual worlds such as Decentraland and Somnium Space, for starters, has allowed for the creation of a novel customer experience in the metaverse. Case in point: Boson Protocol, a DeCo protocol where participants can share in the value they generate through NFTs created with built-in game theory, just spent a record $704,000 on a piece of digital real estate in decentraland to build its first virtual mall on the decentralised virtual reality platform.
        <br /><br />
        The possibilities are tantalizing and hope springs eternal for P2P commerce as evidenced by how virtual reality and the metaverse constantly build up and expand the notion of value.
        <br /><br />
        It’s hard to get off the hopium when the future’s this bright. 
        <br /><br />
        Commerce is dead. 
        <br /><br />
        Long live decentralised commerce.
