        The Creator Economy + Decentralised Commerce
      </h1>

        One of the internet’s monikers during its initial 90s web1 run was the “information superhighway” – a term attributed to former US Senator and Vice President Al Gore when he dreamt of an infobahn whose impact would reach far beyond the halls of academia, towards stimulating economic and educational growth in America (and eventually the rest of the world).
        <br /><br />
        Fast forward thirty years after, the information superhighway has developed at the speed of sound, giving rise to entirely new paradigms of web applications, with the advent of web2 and its centralised exponents – and the emergence of web3, or the internet of value powered by decentralised technology. 
        <br /><br />
        Decentralised technology offers a tantalizing opportunity for individuals to partake in economic and financial activities otherwise only brokered by financial institutions without intermediation. These include activities such as exchanging, lending, borrowing, and investing possible all within a technological milieu that goes beyond promoting the unhampered transfer of information, but also of value.
        <br /><br />
        The intersection of web2 social media platforms and the pivot towards user-generated content in the present context of the internet has given traction to the creator economy – a new model of monetisation enabling individuals to benefit from the content they create, or the passions they dearly hold. This might include the creation of personalized content, knowledge, skills, and other services and products. These include your modern-day vloggers, streamers, drop-shippers, podcasters, writers, digital artists, fashion designers, online store owners, and indie game developers – just to name a few. They’re in every vertical imaginable.
