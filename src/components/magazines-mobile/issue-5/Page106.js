        The good news is that there is a tremendous amount of building that’s going on in this space. The race towards developing tools to capture and deliver that elusive delta is materializing, which is probably the most exciting development in web3 thus far. 
        <br /><br />
        The tools are already here, and the results are promising.
        <br /><br />
        Take, for instance, the emergence of decentralised social media platforms such as Rally, Roll and Mirror. Rally and Roll are open networks that allow creators to monetise their communities through the Ethereum blockchain, enabling them to launch their own social token without having to have the requisite development knowledge required. Creators wishing to launch their tokens and build their own economic future based on their own accountability can do so with ease.
        <br /><br />
        Meanwhile, Mirror.xyz offers a decentralised blockchain platform that seeks to connect audiences with creators who can publish their work and offer them ways to monetise their content directly on-page. 
        <br /><br />
        That’s not to mention the significant difference in take rates – whereas Apple takes 30% of every App Store purchase, YouTube takes 45% of every dollar paid by advertisers. Meanwhile, other platforms like Facebook and TikTok share fuck all. Surprise, surprise!
        <br /><br />
        Meanwhile, platforms like Rally and Mirror take a minuscule 10% and are otherwise focused on giving back that value to their user base and its creators – the lifeblood of their platforms. 
        <br /><br />
        Contrast that to the literal bones web2 platforms throw to creators, in exchange for original content.
