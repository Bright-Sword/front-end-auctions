        DECO Definers.
      </h2>

      <h3>
        DeFi, despite it’s relatively young age has already shown how much wealth potential can be unlocked from traditional finance. Between the triple threat of how much you can do with your cash being continuously enhanced, added transparency and a radical reduction in capital lost to arbitrary or predatory fees, it’s bull season for permissionless innovation.  Know what’s much larger, with a more direct daily impact than finance? That’s right, it’s commerce. Get ready for the running of the DeCo bulls. 
        <br /><br />
        In traditional commerce, barriers to the healthy flow of goods from product ideation all the way through to delivery extract short term gains at every step in the supply chain. And they do it wastefully, ultimately destroying wealth at the expense of producers, consumers, and centralized extractors alike. Decentralized Commerce (DeCo) on the other hand benefits all participants by leveraging the power of community, network effects, secure payments, new layers of programmable personalization, and all the rest of what decentralized consensus tech brings with reach. Creators and collectors or consumers alike can now all share in the surplus economic rewards unlocked by the streamlining of commerce. So for this edition of Web3 Wizards we are attributing those that set the standards for defining DeCo as we experience it today and for the future.
