        <span>1. When you explain Lolli to people, do you ever get anyone saying "No thanks, I don't want free money?"</span>
        <br /><br />
        Unsurprisingly, few people are against earning free money! When it does happen, it‚Äôs usually due to a misconception as the idea of free money might seem ‚Äútoo good to be true.‚Äù Lolli is simple. Brands pay us for sending shoppers their way, and we pay our users in the form of bitcoin, sending free bitcoin to their Lolli.com wallets. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text2}>
        <span>2. How'd you get here and why did you start Lolli?</span>
        <br /><br />
        My co-founder Matt Senter and I previously founded Cosmic, the leading e-commerce gateway technology, which was ultimately acquired in 2017 by Rakuten, the leading cash back rewards program in the US and many parts of the world. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text3}>
        Both Matt and I had long-standing interests in bitcoin and while building Cosmic, it dawned on us that e-commerce rewards would serve as the ideal entry point for bitcoin adoption. With hundreds of millions of people shopping online and interested in earning shopping rewards, giving shoppers bitcoin through a rewards program would create an automatic, zero-barrier entry point to owning bitcoin for the masses. Prior to Lolli, the only way to own bitcoin was to personally invest in it and many interested potential investors were deterred by the idea of putting their money in the relatively new technology. We built Lolli to remove all barriers to entry and make it possible for people to make owning bitcoin as easy as buying groceries or a new pair of shoes. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text4}>
        <span>3. What do you think it is going to take to reach full mainstream adoption? Is everyone waiting on Amazon or can we pass them by?</span>
        <br /><br />
        Achieving mainstream adoption will involve getting bitcoin in the hands of people of all ages, ethnicities, classes, genders, and backgrounds. We‚Äôve already seen incredible progress towards this goal, particularly in the last year, as a number of major institutional investors and companies have embraced bitcoin as part of their business model. As consumer interest in bitcoin has surged, so has interest across industries. Clearly, this is part of a circular effect, as companies respond to popular demand for bitcoin with bitcoin integrations, which in turn fuels greater awareness.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text5}>
        Lolli has had a powerful effect in making thousands of merchants bitcoin-friendly, familiarizing top retailers and Fortune 500 companies with bitcoin through the rewards experience. This is a perfect way for these businesses to become acclimated to, and interested in bitcoin. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text6}>
        Amazon is an undeniably powerful player and its full embrace of bitcoin would obviously have outsized implications for bitcoin; however, when Amazon does integrate bitcoin into its business model, it will be playing catch-up with other powerful companies, all of which will be responding to exceptional consumer interest in bitcoin.  As more and more institutions adopt bitcoin and see increased revenue streams from their dealings with crypto, Amazon‚Äìand other companies‚Äìwill inevitably take note and adjust accordingly, or fall behind and lose out on a massive business opportunity. 
        <br /><br />
        That said, I‚Äôm not waiting on Amazon‚Äôs entry into bitcoin or cryptocurrency to validate what is abundantly clear‚Äìthat people want to use, earn, and own bitcoin.

          4. You seem really with it and up to date with decentralised/web3 culture, I'm sure that your urban dictionary pages are well worn üòÜ, what is your take on NFTs, and do you have any favourites?
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        NFTs will revolutionize the game for creators and consumers. NFTs have extremely exciting, far-reaching use cases across culture, arts, business, and daily life. While we‚Äôre already seeing a proliferation of creative applications for the technology, we are simply at the tip of the iceberg.
        <br /><br />
        <span>
          5. Lolli is focused on Bitcoin at the moment. When can we expect an expansion into Eth and ERC-20 land?
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        Bitcoin has been hands down the most secure, valuable digital asset since its inception. That‚Äôs why Lolli issues users bitcoin rewards. There may be a time that we integrate other currencies and capabilities into our wallet when other cryptocurrencies prove their value and the market demands it.
        <br /><br />
        <span>
          6. What do you say to people who say decentralised commerce isn't needed, that the system we have is good enough?
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        It‚Äôs not about telling, it‚Äôs about showing. Side-by-side, looking at bitcoin as a store of value and fiat currencies over time, the numbers speak for themselves. Inflation erodes the value of government-issued fiat currencies over time, destroying the individual‚Äôs buying power, whereas bitcoin‚Äôs value increases over time due to its capped supply of 21 million bitcoin, thus making bitcoin sounder money by far than fiat currency, if not the soundest money in the world. At the moment, inflation is a hot topic given the infusion of new money into the U.S. economy from the COVID relief bill. We‚Äôre going to increasingly see concerns about inflation materialize, particularly as awareness of bitcoin as an alternative to our current financial system draws people‚Äôs attention to its faults.
