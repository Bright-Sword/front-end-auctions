        We will see new nations form out of digital economies, complete with their own systems of governance and property rights. Trust in traditional institutions is collapsing and digitally native economies will fill the power vacuums that form. The metaverse will be somewhere that we can live, work, and play. P2E will attract hundreds of millions of dreamers to digital economies.
