      <div className={styles.title1}>A Mindset for the Metaverse</div>
      <h1 className={styles.text1}>
        The concept of the "metaverse" has been used in countless sci-fi tropes (most notably Neal
        Stephenson's Snow Crash) before the term caught on, and its nebulous definitions have gone
        beyond the realm of gaming with which it is inextricably intertwined.
        <br />
        <br /> The tantalizing prospect of living in a virtual world unbound by the constraints of
        the all-too-mundane reality of the material world is now coming to pass, and it's no longer
        restricted to a subset of the population immersed in these extended realities — gamers.
        <br />
        <br /> Perhaps venture capitalist Matthew Ball put it best when he stated that the metaverse
        "isn't a game, a piece of hardware, or an online experience." Instead, it's a successor to
        the internet that features as many protocols, technologies, devices, languages, content, and
        immersive user experiences driven by gaming, social media, and the ever-increasing shift
        towards a fully digital economy.
        <br />
        <br /> One thing's for sure: the metaverse will continue to defy conventional definitions as
        it constantly evolves. And, as the pieces all fall into place at a frighteningly rapid pace
        (thanks to the coronavirus pandemic), there is a massive need for the millions upon millions
        of individuals to adapt to living in these limitless virtual universes as they come to life.
        Thus, we need a blueprint for living in the metaverse.
        <br />
        <br />
        After all, the metaverse is the future, the metaverse is here, and metaverse is here to
        stay. So long as the metaverse's future remains uncertain and its evolution constant, we may
        as well learn how to adapt, learn the language, and integrate to the culture of the virtual
        worlds none of us are genuinely native in.

      <div className={styles.title2}>The Importance of "Mental Stimulation"</div>
      <div className={styles.text2}>
        Americans aren't big on thinking about the future. A survey conducted by the Institute for
        the Future showed that Americans barely think of the future five years from now and onwards.
        This is symptomatic of the so-called future gap — a gap that leads to impulsive and
        antisocial behavior.
        <br />
        <br />
        Anyone can be an armchair quarterback when hindsight is 20/20. But it's fascinating to think
        about how different the global response to COVID might have been if we'd asked the same
        questions about dealing with a similar pandemic five or ten years ago. The same is true if
        we had confronted the question of how social media and memes could be weaponized to
        disinform masses and influence election outcomes earlier than we did as a society.
        <br />
        <br />
        Therefore, there is a need to reassess and think more deliberately about the future as it
        emerges in the metaverse to be better trained to solve problems and identify meaningful
        trends in it, especially considering its massive potential to redefine society as we know
        it.
        <br />
        <br />
        But before anyone dismisses the value of being curious about the future as mere mental
        stimulation, it's important to note that spotting trends and leveraging them is critical if
        we wish to create meaningful, tangible, and long-term changes in our lives. The same is true
        if we want to do the same for the dynamic physical and digital realms we inhabit. As
        futurist entrepreneur and author Rohit Bhargava puts it, the future belongs to those who can
        see what others don't.
