        <div className={styles.title1}>Free Your Mind</div>
        <div className={styles.text1}>
          The ability to think like a futurist is essential to living in the metaverse as it
          unfolds, especially because literally anything and everything in the digital realms can be
          worlds away from how we've experienced life thus far — and we're fast accelerating this
          digital transformation.
          <br />
          <br /> Keeping an open mind to the possibilities of a dynamic environment is something
          that futurists have done for ages, and that's the same mindset that immigrants to the
          metaverse —all of us ­­— need.
          <br />
          <br />
          Game designer, author, and futurist extraordinaire Jane McGonigal stated that it's all a
          matter of detaching yourself from your ideas of what you believe is possible. This is
          possible by looking for evidence that everything is subject to change — even something
          that has been accepted as gospel truth for millennia. Like McGonigal's future, the
          metaverse is a place where everything is literally and figuratively different, so the same
          futuristic and open mindset is a prerequisite in the latter. Once our minds are removed
          from the constraints of what we think is possible, we can then believe in creative,
          alternative, and equally favorable outcomes.
          <br />
          <br />
          McGonigal, who teaches a class on futurist thinking at Stanford University, provided three
          concrete exercises on how to think like one:
        </div>
        <br />
        <div className={styles.title2}>Predicting the past.</div>
        <div className={styles.text2}>
          Predicting historical events sounds like an oxymoron (if not contradictory), but
          understanding the past helps individuals detect patterns. Moreover, it helps us understand
          that the future isn't cut and dried yet — we all have the agency to reimagine the outcomes
          of our actions had we made a different decision in a particular situation. Ask yourself
          how another course of action might have led to a different future.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div className={styles.title3}>Recalling the future. </div>
        <div className={styles.text3}>
          Remembering future events is akin to visualizing a future scenario wherein you achieve the
          desired outcome. From there, you would then need to explain how you reached the said
          outcome. Doing so trains your mind to believe that the desired result is more likely to
          occur because your brain has taken a picture of that scenario.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div className={styles.title4}>Practicing "hard" empathy.</div>
        <div className={styles.text4}>
          Hard empathy is putting yourself through a totally unfamiliar experience. Put yourself in
          the shoes of a total stranger from a country you've never heard before. How would they
          react to a particular situation? How would they live through a specific reality? By
          completely divorcing ourselves from our all-consuming solipsism and empathizing with
          another, we can glean new insights from another point of view.
