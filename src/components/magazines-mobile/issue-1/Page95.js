        Raising Your Marketing Game
        <br />
        <br />
        We've all heard the "starving artist" trope. We've also heard the stereotypical assertion
        that artists aren't generally renowned marketers. But in this frenzied environment that art
        finds itself in, artists can only survive by marketing their works of art. Therefore,
        today's digital creators need an adequate marketing strategy to give themselves the best
        chance to succeed.
        <br />
        <br />
        Marketing is no longer about drawing attention in a saturated market; rather, it is about
        fostering dialog with fellow travelers in the customer journey. Gone are the days of
        conventional marketing solely driven by generating sales. We're in an environment that puts
        building relationships and serving those who share their passion to mutual benefit, rather
        than an exploitative, predatory one, one that's solely interested in increasing the bottom
        line by any means necessary.

        Here are some essential marketing tips for creatives in the space:
        <br />
        <br />
        Build a tribe.
        <br /> Seth Godin put it best when he said that people need to find their tribe. Creators do
        too. There's no way out of it — you need to be out there to find your tribe of followers,
        friends, fans, and believers who resonate with your worldview. Don't overthink: what matters
        most is establishing trust. The medium isn’t the constraint.
        <br />
        <br />
        Engage the Community.
        <br /> Community is the backbone of crypto, and NFTs aren't exempted. Therefore building one
        — your tribe, as it were — is of utmost importance. These are the individuals who invest in
        you as a creator, spread the word about you, and buy or help sell your NFTs. Social media is
        your friend: Twitter, Telegram, Discord, Reddit, Medium, and LinkedIn are all critical
        promotional platforms that engage individuals in the space, educate normies about NFTs and
        digital art, and receive valuable feedback across all audiences. Dialog is crucial more than
        ever, and these tools will help your harness its power to provide value to the community and
        establish authority and trust.

        Get listed on marketplaces.  OpenSea, Rarible, Foundation and SuperRare are among the most
        common NFT marketplaces to sell your ideas and artwork. Each has its unique features,
        benefits, and drawbacks, so always read through the fine print of how they work and if it
        fits your project.
