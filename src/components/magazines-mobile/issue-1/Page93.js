        Four years before longtime Premier League strugglers Leicester City FC defied all odds to
        win their first league title in its entire 135-year history in 2016 as 5,000-to-1 underdogs,
        legendary Foxes striker Jamie Vardy was languishing in the seventh tier of the English
        football system for the Stocksbridge Park Steels.

      <div className={styles.text2}>
        Vardy went from playing against part-timers while working odd jobs to sustain his dream of
        playing at the highest level of competitive football there is — and in doing so, led his
        team to the apex of the English game. The story of how Leicester City won it all in 2016
        remains one of the most captivating, inspiring stories for a club that struggled for its
        entire existence, and the same is true for Vardy's rise from the pub leagues to the pros.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, you might be wondering: what does this have anything to do with the emerging digital
        art and NFT scene?
        <br />
        <br />
        Well, there are parallels to be drawn between the struggle behind Vardy's rise and the
        struggle that creators in this nascent industry — ones that saw unprecedented, eye-watering
        amounts of money and hype pour into the industry this year. Likewise, there are lessons to
        be learned from Vardy's journey from the pub league to the pros, and how constant
        improvement and adaptation are necessary for all artists in these heady times.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unprecedented Sales in a Stabilizing Industry The first quarter of 2021 saw $2 billion in
        NFT sales — 20 times the previous quarter's volume — with twice as many buyers than there
        were sellers. Now that the media feeding frenzy that broke out earlier this year is tapering
        off, NFT prices are dropping from their February peaks, as their average prices
        significantly increase since then — a sign of a maturing, stable industry.
        <br />
        <br />
        With all the money that's flowed into the scene — Beeple's $69 million NFT sale comes to
        mind — fortunes were and still are in the process of being made, and we can't stress how
        early we still are. More importantly, digital artists are finally getting recognition,
        respect, and financial compensation for their art and uniquely monetizing their creativity.
        In addition, NFTs empower creators, giving them an unparalleled sense of agency to take
        complete control and ownership of what they want to do with their creations.
