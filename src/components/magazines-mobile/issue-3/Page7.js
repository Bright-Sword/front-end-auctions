      <p className={styles.text1}>We’ve also seen this play out in the way technology has evolved—particularly in how the internet has come from the rudimentary, static text-and-photos web1 years, to web2 or the internet as we largely recognize it today (hello, FAANG), and to the nascent stages of web3: the new era of decentralized, permissionless networks.
<br/><br/>
Let’s take a look at how we got here.
<br/><br/>
Web2 and the dictatorship of stasis
Every single evolution brought on by technology has brought on these splits in opinion—and the internet is proof positive of this. When web1 first came into being between the individuals who were bullish about how the internet would democratize information and allow billions of people around the world the power to be heard and communicate at the drop of a hat. The nascent community was eager to identify problems, and therefore create solutions to manage them in an open manner, as opposed to a regulation that forced them to. Hell, back in those days, Google used to end with a .org. Those were the golden days. Right before the fabric of the internet would be subverted and warped by society and the forces—the corporates—that eventually came to supersede it.
<br/><br/>
On the other hand, those in favor of stasis demanded government intervention to quash what they saw as a cesspool of hate speech, deranged and discredited political ideas, a tool for scammers, terrorists, and miscreants all over the world.
<br/><br/>
Well, that’s no different from what happened as web1 began its baby steps into web2: the internet as we recognize it today. An internet dominated by interactive, user-generated content, and the one that brought us the myriad of apps and services we use on a daily basis. This includes the Apples, Googles, and Ubers of the world and their ilk, to which we sacrifice our privacy and personal freedoms to the altar of their centralized, sanitized platforms and services. Step out of line? You’re toast. Have a ban, thanks for playing.
<br/><br/>
It’s the same structure playing out. Every. Single. Time.
<br/><br/>
We saw this with Linux being called a “cancer” on the industry that needed to be excised by an industry fat cat belonging to what was then the poster boy of despicable, monolithic big tech: Microsoft.
<br/><br/>
More recently, the well-publicized beef that played out between Epic Games and Apple is indicative of the ongoing struggle between the forces of dynamism and stasis, with the Fortnite publisher making a legal challenge to the restrictive rules that the Cupertino-based tech giant over other in-app purchasing methods—while taking a hefty 30% from every sale on their app store.
<br/><br/>
As we have seen time and time again, the very same entrepreneurs and the communities that spurred the growth of a new technology—web1, for instance—have essentially lived long enough to see themselves become the villains. As the sun set on web1, web2 emerged, remodeling the internet into the image of the corporations that now dominate the space—each one fighting tooth and nail for your personal information by offering their services in return for it. From Facebook, to Twitter, to Instagram, all the way to TikTok, you are the product.
