      <p className={styles.text1}>Why DeFi? <br/>
In many ways, much of what drives the DeFi ecosystem’s unprecedented growth is tied to the inherently flawed, inadequate, or fragile systems of monolithic, centralized, and traditional “big finance.”
<br/><br/>
Such historical inefficiencies are responsible for the operational risks we associate with finance, such as fraud, data breaches, white-collar crime, and its undesirable ilk.
<br/><br/>
The decentralized manner in which DeFi operates seeks to correct the operational risks associated with conventional finance.
<br/><br/>
DeFi’s increasing popularity has offered tremendous potential in correcting the pitfalls of traditional finance as far as access to banking and financial services is concerned. With over 2 billion individuals currently without access to either, it’s tantalizing to think how DeFi might be able to empower billions to take control of their finances without all the hoops they need to jump through to get served—while participating in an inclusive, antifragile industry that can potentially generate the income needed to improve their financial situation.
<br/><br/>
Meanwhile, DeFi offers a more customized, flexible user experience for the rest of the banked population, giving them access to the same products and services (if not strictly better ones) and giving them the reps they need to understand the basics of finance.
<br/><br/>
DeFi operationalizes the basic tenets of blockchain decentralization as applied to a spectrum of banking and financial services, made possible by developing dapps built on its public infrastructure.
<br/><br/>
And DeFi posits a plausible solution to the constantly widening gap in the distribution of wealth among the nations—which was essentially a direct result of the centralized, circuitous, and monolithic nature of the financial services industry. DeFi is just the disruption the industry needs to remediate the age-old problem of economic inequality, which is itself rooted in the nature of the financial beast.
<br/><br/>
The tantalizing promise of DeFi<br/>
DeFi posits a decentralized alternative built on the principles of fairness, inclusivity, openness, anonymity, and transparency. There’s no endless cabal of repugnant and pompous intermediaries to deal with to make your hard-earned money work for you. There’s no “install this app and register to use our services so we can sell you more things you don’t need.” Peter doesn’t need to go through arduous KYC processes to pay Paul. There are no ridiculous barriers to entry to participate—social/industry clout, wealth, and location be damned. In DeFi, inclusion, fairness, and equity are real.
<br/><br/>
DeFi is the antithesis of traditional finance. Here’s why:
<br/><br/>
DeFi is permissionless. Anyone with an internet connection can access DeFi apps. There’s no KYC, there’s no endless bureaucracy, and there are no credit checks. There are no gatekeepers—users get to directly interact with DeFi smart contracts on blockchain protocols straight from their wallets.<br/>
DeFi is trustless. No centralized authority needs to be trusted to guarantee the validity of transactions.<br/>
DeFi is transparent. DeFi dapps are built on transparent, immutable, and auditable blockchains, primarily Ethereum.<br/>
DeFi is programmable. Unlike traditional finance, where any innovation, creation, or development needs to go through layers and layers of complex rules, regulations, and obstacles, DeFi devs can engineer, combine, and freely put together financial services of their choice at a substantially lesser cost. Just like Lego pieces can be composed, so are DeFi applications.<br/>
DeFi is resistant to censorship. No centralized authority can reverse transactions, nor can some gormless, faceless corporation allow or deny services to anyone.<br/>
DeFi is efficient. </p>
