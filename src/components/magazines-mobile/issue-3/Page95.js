       <p className={styles.text1}>Plus, with stablecoins, users practically slash their risk next to zero such that even if the tokens they farm lose value, they still profit from lending their liquidity. It’s no surprise more and more individuals, regardless of background, are attracted to DeFi’s promise to uplift their economic situation.
<br/><br/>
However, DeFi does have more than a modicum of risk involved. That’s because as the space is so young, even the most popular DeFi protocols are built by small, nimble teams working with a tight budget, which might expose their project to a spanner in the smart contract works. Even the most valuable, transparent protocols have been hacked.
<br/><br/>
Scams are rife, and there is no shortage of hacks, and fraudulent projects have been reported on a regular basis. 
<br/><br/>
In the end, the risks are an acceptable tradeoff for the promise that decentralization brings to finance, especially the billions upon billions of essentially disenfranchised, unbanked, and excluded individuals who stand to gain the most out of it.
<br/><br/>
Every upheaval starts has to start somewhere—and we’re seeing the initial salvos of change being fired into the air. It’s a good time to be into DeFi—no matter who you are.</p>
