      <p className={styles.text1}>Quite frankly, we still lack understanding of the true value of digital assets, with buyers largely paying over the odds for novelty and the experience of owning an NFT. And try as we might, there exists no price mechanism governing novelty.
<br/><br/>
Nevertheless, digital collectibles remain a key growth sector in the crypto space—and as we will discuss, NFTs and DeFi are starting to come together, posing more use cases for NFTs that go far beyond clout and bragging rights. Here’s how.
<br/><br/>
NFTs + DeFi: the merging<br/>
Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is an entirely new financial ecosystem borne from the blockchain, particularly on Ethereum, where most of the development in the decentralized finance space is ongoing. Thanks to tools such as smart contracts, cryptocurrencies, price oracles, and decentralized apps, DeFi democratizes and disintermediates traditional finance. Simply put, anything you can do in a bank, such as credit, loans, invoicing, insurance, and trading, can be done through DeFi using dapps. DeFi empowers individuals by removing the pervasive intermediaries that persist in the world of traditional finance and therefore allowing them the agency to act in their own best interests—not the banks, not the VCs, and not their owners.
<br/><br/>
And, as the crow flies, it turns out that NFTs and DeFi are already intersecting right from underneath our noses, as traditional media remains fixated almost solely on the speculative nature of the former and the potential for massive gains in the case of the latter.
<br/><br/>
As NFTs are now standardized to allow greater interoperability (thanks to the ERC-1155 standard), we see how the characteristic of uniqueness on the blockchain applies to virtual goods, such as video games, art, music, and the like. Now, unique assets can be easily moved between one dapp to another, offering a host of new use cases—particularly in DeFi.
<br/><br/>
More than just digital art<br/>
But NFTs are more than just mere digital art—they are now in the process of being used to create new, exciting financial products that go way beyond the current price discovery mechanisms of sales on NFT marketplaces with very little pricing information to go about (and therefore very illiquid). On the other hand, auctions tend to be more suited toward art, where value is in the eye of the beholder. Fractionalization opens the door for investors to buy a fraction of an NFT, sharding them into ERC-20 tokens that may gain liquidity on a decentralized (or centralized) exchange.
<br/><br/>
The financialization of NFTs will open the door to new protocols, derivatives, and exchanges—and while price discovery remains a monkey on its back, the development of capital-efficient financial mechanisms will lead to faster transactions, tokenization-driven improvements in liquidity, the creation of derivatives with underlying NFTs as instruments, and turn them into collateral without the need for order books. Price discovery, therefore, would play a pivotal role in merging NFTs into DeFi.</p>
