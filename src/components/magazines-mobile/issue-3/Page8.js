      <p className={styles.text2}>We’ve handed over our personal information so that some advertiser gets to shill us products. Worse, once we’ve handed it over, there’s no telling how any of these faceless entities use or store them. Data breaches are a constant occurrence. Countless terabytes of personal information have been exposed, and will continue to be exposed for as long as there is one single point of failure housing such data.
        <br/><br/>
The very same companies that once opened the door to information and personal expression have essentially become the very same monopolies they once sought to topple. And they have trillions of reasons why they should keep their dictatorship firmly entrenched as the gatekeepers and tastemakers for the people.
<br/><br/>
But the advent of web3 is just about to change that.
<br/><br/>
Web3 and the case for dynamism
Web3’s capabilities are the logical answers to the most insidious aspects of web2, and its inherently open, decentralized nature is perfectly suited to reap the benefits of dynamism. Web3 brings back the agency of creators and consumers to truly own wealth and share in the economic gains of the ecosystems they choose to participate in. NFTs have provided value in allowing creators to take back ownership of their digital creations and build new ways to express oneself in the emerging metaverse. Digital identities will come to pass since your data belongs to you again—the blockchain has no need for KYC for them to keep tabs on your activities. 
<br/><br/>
Then, in the next emerging blockchain trend, the decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)  that redefine ownership, which tend to value social clout over eye-watering financial potential. Web3 natives holding governance tokens of the “tribe” they might belong to gives them the voice, clout, and agency to facilitate management and decision-making to improve the state of the community and its members—all of which have their skin in the game in the survival and success of the organization they belong to. That, as opposed to the  Gone are the days of platforms overstepping the bounds of free speech and intellectual property ownership—this is the new Magna Carta for the new internet age.
<br/><br/>
Web3 has provided a dynamic answer to the worst excesses of web2 to provide a fair, more equitable share in ownership, incentives, reputation, and governance, in an open, immutable, and transparent environment. 
<br/><br/>
Open, dynamic systems across culture, economics, science, and art diminish the stranglehold of centralized authority in such fields—the proponents and self-proclaimed gatekeepers and tastemakers of which have decided that the nuanced problems that pervade our society should all conform to a single formula. They thrive on decentralization, competition, evolution, and criticism.
<br/><br/>
And, in spite of the agents of stasis that have sought time and again to suppress the emergence of a better deal, a clear path for dynamic thinkers to build towards progress lies right in front of us: web3. 
<br/><br/>
It’s time to know the real enemy of all change: stasis.
