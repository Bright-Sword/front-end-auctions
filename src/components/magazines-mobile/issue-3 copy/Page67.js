      <p className={styles.text3}>Life is inherently asymmetrical. Nowhere is this more evident than the flawed, chaotic plane of existence we exist in.
<br/><br/>
Despite the entirely understandable human need for order, stability, and predictability—and therefore, symmetry—in everything we do, we’re out here on our own, flapping in the wind, constantly dangling on the edge of this precarious mortal coil.
<br/><br/>
Symmetry is something we inherently strive for, whether in our relationships, career, finances, business, and health.
<br/><br/>
But the asymmetrical nature of life results in a constant struggle to capture value in anything and everything that we do. It’s the wild card that throws this world of ours in the dysfunctional state it’s currently in.
<br/><br/>
However, this fundamentally unpredictable world is what separates the wheat from the chaff—even from a strictly evolutionary perspective, species evolve to become more resilient as a result of stressful, traumatic external changes. It’s the Darwinian precept of natural selection played out in every human endeavor throughout history.</p>
