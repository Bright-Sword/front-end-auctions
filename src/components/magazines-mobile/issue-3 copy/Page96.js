      <p className={styles.text1}>This kills the intermediary. Smart contracts can be developed to match customers. There’s entirely no need for a couple of strangers heading down to the bank branch to borrow or to lend and the bank to essentially match the lender with the borrower on top of a hefty fee. The smart contract enables the lender to deposit their money directly on the blockchain for the borrower to withdraw under a predetermined set of criteria baked into the code.

DeFi use cases are growing exponentially, ranging from options trading platforms, lending protocols, prediction markets, decentralized exchanges, liquidity mining protocols, stablecoins, and payment integrations, among others.
<br/><br/>
DeFi empowers the user to take the basic elements of the financial markets and its existing infrastructure, which includes credit activities or transactions like exchanging and settlements through software that runs entirely on the internet, devoid of any institutional baggage that CeFi markets invariably have baked in.
<br/><br/>
For instance, a crypto holder could theoretically place funds into a decentralized lending protocol like Aave to earn interest at significantly higher rates than your garden variety savings account could ever give—but with consequently greater risk.
<br/><br/>
But on a more concrete level: how can you make money with DeFi right now?
<br/><br/>
Making bank with DeFi<br/>
There are more than a few ways to skin a cat, and there are just as many ways to make bank in DeFi.
<br/><br/>
Liquidity Pools<br/>
And it all starts with one of its fundamental technologies that make up DeFi as we know it today: liquidity pools. Liquidity pools power credit (borrow/lend) protocols, yield farming, automated market makers, synthetic derivatives, and insurance, among several new applications. They drive almost every facet of DeFi and will remain to do so in the coming years.
<br/><br/>
The premise is simple: liquidity pools are basically a pool of funds put together in a permissionless environment where any individual can add or remove liquidity. And it is the basis of numerous iterations for generating yield.
<br/><br/>
One of the most well-known iterations of DeFi is yield farming. Liquidity pools comprise the backbone of the Yearn yield-generating platform, where individuals can deposit their funds into pools used to generate yield for every participant.</p>
