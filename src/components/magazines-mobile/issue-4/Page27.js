      <p className={styles.text18}>We all heard about the Titan project collapse on Polygon, and this especially gained more attention due to Mark Cuban ape’ing into the project. Of course this was no relation to or fault of the Polygon team, but how do you feel in general about a lot of the meme coin and quick gains / pump and dump projects coming into DeFi? Is this something that people should be jumping into for a quick high risk profit or is it something that they should be staying far away from? </p>
      <p className={styles.text19}>Iron particularly was more of an economical exploit. The way these algorithmic stablecoins   grow so rapidly is by giving high emissions on the seniorage token (TITAN in this case). Thereby reducing collateral ratio of the stablecoin and releasing a ton of TITAN in the market. Certain whales start tweeting about their LPs and gains - seemed to be an exit liquidity event for earlier whales, whilst being a FOMO event for newbies. When this happens, whales dump on the noobs and with TITAN being dumped upon them - broke IRON peg and things deflated very quickly.

People have to understand DeFi is still a very risky endeavour, especially if its not blue chip project like AAVE or Curve. I understand where you are coming from and totally agree on the bad optics that goes out. Polygon is a permissionless blockchain - we cant censor or stop projects from building here even if we wanted to. Its technically impossible. Investors should read the documentations, ask community in telegram/discord etc about loopholes in the economic model and educate themselves before putting there hard earned money. 
</p>
      <p className={styles.text20}>With what risk appetite should people approach DeFi on Polygon? There is a lot of comments about it being more riskier than DeFi on Ethereum since it’s a Layer 2. What are your thoughts on this?</p>
      <p className={styles.text21}>I am not sure what you mean by “riskier than Ethereum”. Most of Ethereum bluechips like AAVE, Curve, SushiSwap, Kyber, Balancer and many others have chosen Polygon as there scaling solution. We dont endorse or recommend any investments, but these are projects that are battle tested code, reviewed by top teams in the blockchain space and widely respected throughout. As I said, Polygon is still very early in this DeFi phase and we have a long way to go. 
      <br/><br/>
As for Polygon chain’s security, we have over 100 validators that are hosted on Ethereum mainchain. These include some of the most well reputed professional staking firms across all blockchains with over $2B staked. 
</p>
      <p className={styles.text22}>What’s the future of Polygon and DeFi? As Polygon expands further to scale as an entire ecosystem supported by Ethereum as its Layer 1, how do you see more projects being able to leverage off of the new tools and infrastructure being built out? Is there anything specific that people should be paying attention to? </p>
      <p className={styles.text23}>The future is difficult to predict since we are a long way into building it. Multichain is definitely a world, many web3 applications like SportX have used Polygon SDK to build there own chain to scale to million users. Very interesting concept. Polygon recently launched Data availability solution that fits right into our vision for rollups (optimistic and ZK). These infrastructure will help dapps to scale in ways not possible before.</p>
      <p className={styles.text24}>And finally, for a new person wanting to start learning more about Polygon and start taking actions to interact with the network and the different projects and DAPPs built on top of it. Where do they go?
</p>
<p className={styles.text25}>Try with a small amount on top dapps like QuickSwap, AAVE, Curve etc. Play around in a low gas environment before going full pro. Play it safe and learn first.
