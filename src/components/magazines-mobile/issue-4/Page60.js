        Online payment systems often grind friction in global commerce, with disenfranchising effects to those that can afford it the least. 
        <br /><br />
        Take, for instance, the $500 billion that flows across borders in the form of remittances, the majority of which are money transfers from migrant workers to their families in their home countries sent regularly. 
        <br /><br />
        Once all the intermediaries have been paid off for vouching for your transaction, sending costs can rise as high as 17%. That’s about $40 billion in aggregate costs yearly.
        <br /><br />
        The thing is, those 15-17% fees add up, especially for countries like the Philippines, where remittances bolster a fractious economy—to the tune of 10% of the country’s GDP.
        <br /><br />
        Remittances, like online payments, travel across continents, currencies, and financial institutions—all of which set up substantial hurdles for every stakeholder involved in the process
        <br /><br />
        Like e-commerce payment processors, remittances fees are a source of financial friction for low-to-medium income families who depend on remittances for their livelihood. That extra 7% the processor takes is a lot of money in a country where the minimum daily wage is $10. That’s constant friction for immigrants who need to transmit much smaller “micro” transactions on a more frequent basis. The system taxes the weakest that rely on them the most. Where have I heard that before?
        <br /><br />
        One of the main causes of payment friction in commerce is the fact that online payment systems aren’t interoperable. They’re all siloed, they’re all stuck in each of their own walled gardens, making synergistic connections between financial institutions and systems a haphazardly stitched-together circuitous patchwork of workarounds without anything unifying them to move money around in a truly frictionless manner.
        <br /><br />
        Part of the problem is that systems are not interoperable. To send money to different corners of the world without blockchain, a whole patchwork has been haphazardly knitted together over the decades to achieve some semblance of financial interoperability between financial institutions, correspondent banks and money transfer operators along the value chain.
