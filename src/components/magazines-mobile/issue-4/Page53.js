        Been doing art since I was a kid. Went to art and design school and majored in industrial design. Was a design educator after college. Did some art shows, mostly doing art toys. Started doing 3d art again 2019, used to 3d art back in college, since 3d programs were needed in industrial design . Found out about nfts during the defi summer of 2020. Was already into crypto for a while. Even used the computer lab at the school i was teaching at to mine dogecoin. Ssshhh lol. Found it really interesting to see art being sold as crypto. Started to mint some of my works and thankfully had a few buys during my first month which fuelled me to make more.

        NFTs are still a very small subset of the art scene of the Philippines. It has helped a lot for us who are digital native artists who have a hard time showing our work in traditional art settings. Its a very tight knit community that formed during the rise of NFTs from late 2020 to early 2021. I think it was because we were in lockdown that for me personally I socialized more on the internet, via discord and twitter. Prior to that I never really interacted with the digital art community either locally or abroad.

        I am into moving to the edges of digital art using VR/AR, 3d art, sound design. I'm interested in the intersection between tech and ecology. I also use psychedelic inspired aesthetics and themes in a lot of my work.

        I think the Philippines has, by far, the most users of Axie Infinity. I think it is a great starting point for users to understand the underlying tech behind NFTs and would transition towards the understanding of cryptoart easier than other countries. I can imagine once the ecosystem becomes mature that creators using NFTs would have a sustainable means of living hopefully in the near future and the "hungry artist" becomes a thing of the past.
