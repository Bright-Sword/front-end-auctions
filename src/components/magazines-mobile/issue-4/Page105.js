        Fortunately, decentralisation is releasing the pressure on web2’s stranglehold on the narrative, leading to the sundering of the monoliths that impede the free transfer of value that is waiting to be unlocked.
        <br /><br />
        DeFi – and by extension, DeCo (decentralised commerce) – offers a better alternative to solving the current pitfalls that passion economy participants and platforms alike face. Smart contracts offer a solution to the ever-complex problem of working out a mutually beneficial and scalable compensation and benefits scheme that may involve a lot of wrangling between aligning cash- and equity-based incentives. 
        <br /><br />
        It also provides an on-ramp for participants who wouldn’t otherwise be in crypto a reason to do so by patronising their favourite artists, brands, and entrepreneurs – therefore boosting further crypto adoption.
        <br /><br />
        NFTs take the concept to a whole new level, making the concept of decentralised commerce even closer to fruition by providing the marketplaces, tools, and technology infrastructure needed to turn diffuse elements of post-internet consumption and cultural shifts in behaviour towards something more tangible, something more representative of ownership – immutably recorded on the distributed ledger with finality. NFTs commoditise the clout that is inherent in human nature, which is what everyone should be looking at, rather than the prices that they go for on auction. 
        <br /><br />
        But that’s just scratching the surface of what could be the dawning of a new economic paradigm whose effects and consequences will be far-ranging and volatile, but would definitely hold the key to unlocking the immense value just waiting to be tapped.
