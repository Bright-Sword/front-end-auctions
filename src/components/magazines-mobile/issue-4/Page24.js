        It’s also a textbook case of how a once-beloved startup that grew big and lived long enough to see itself become the villain—like most of the Commerce 2.0 stalwarts like Walmart, eBay, and Etsy have become.
        <br /><br />
        Amazon, which once operated out of a nondescript house in Washington state, has become such a dominant force in online retail that it has a virtual monopoly on e-commerce–thought to be as much as over 50% of the market. But you don’t become the world’s richest man without stepping on anybody else’s toes, and that fact is not lost on the millions looking for a better solution than Amazon.
        <br /><br />
        For years, Bezos has employed predatory pricing tactics to pound the competition into submission using its vast reserves of resources. Amazon didn’t turn a profit until 7 years after its inception in 2001, practically built its wealth on undercutting prices, bullying third-party sellers into using their platform, and extracting resources from governments in the United States and the rest of the world. It’s the Silicon Valley™ way: burn through capital in order to buy their way into success. Customers may benefit from lower prices in the short-term. But ultimately, monopolists care fuck all about the employees.
        <br /><br />
        Amazon, for the longest time, was exempted from sales tax in many states until a few years ago, and its overreliance on remote fulfillment centers, abject working conditions, and minimum wage labor guarantees that the profit margins are fully maximised to the hilt.
        <br /><br />
        It doesn’t get better for third-party sellers on Amazon, either—apart from the cost of Amazon FBA, which isn’t exactly a pittance, the ultimate cost of becoming part of the Amazon Death Star was the commoditization of a brand and its products within its walled gardens (*coofs* Apple *coofs*).
        <br /><br />
        Merchants have no ownership of their brand, and become one of the thousands of faceless brands that Amazon itself competes directly against by privately labeling and distributing its own white-label versions of the best-selling products at much lower overhead than its third-party sellers could. It doesn’t matter if your company is in fashion, electronics, food and beverage, or consumables—Amazon is likely competing against you underneath your nose, using the same predatory tactics. Go against the TOS for any perceived wrongthink or violation? Get yeeted.
        <br /><br />
        The undeniable truth is that private companies and multibillionaires can do as they please—and their attempts at dick-waving and subsequent kowtowing by the subservient media to them are abundantly clear. All is fair in love and capitalism.
        <br /><br />
        But there is an alternative to the excesses of Web and Commerce 2.0 and its inevitable overreach into every aspect of our lives, including commerce: decentralisation.
        <br /><br />
        The crux of the biscuit is that no one man, consortium, or corporation should have all that power to single-handedly dictate the way we conduct commerce. And the decentralisation of the online marketplaces and public spaces users frequent offer a way to empower them and give them the agency to decide their own fate–particularly the ones that don’t have the same access to the vast financial and infrastructural resources these e-commerce giants possess.
