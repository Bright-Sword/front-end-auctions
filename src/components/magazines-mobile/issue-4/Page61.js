        Connecting these disparate systems, particularly in underserved markets, where the local currency is not globally<br />
        traded, has created friction that results in long delays and high fees at each link of this chain.
        <br /><br />
        The complex network of correspondent banks each have their own set of tedious bureaucratic regulations governing the use and processing of data, which requires a sophisticated level of expertise to navigate. A misspelled field or an errant stroke can lead to a whole lot of friction, or when they fill out a form in the wrong format. It’s even harder to automate cross-border payments when the infrastructure is fragmented and lacking in oversight. 
        <br /><br />
        Ultimately, it’s nigh impossible to remove friction from traditional commerce and finance when friction is practically baked into its code. 
        <br /><br />
        The open networks that underpin web3 ensure that they can build on the technology to take the concept to the next level. The interoperability that such networks promise to allow for constant evolution. Building such infrastructure into a walled garden would run counter to the ideals of decentralisation.  
        <br /><br />
        DeFi is emerging as a potential solution to offer the financial services we often take for granted to the 1.7 billion unbanked individuals who can’t access financial services because they lack the necessary documentation, the means, or the bother of jumping through hoops designed to keep some of them out. That’s not to mention the 4 billion who are yet to gain internet access. DeFi democratises access to the financial instruments we take for granted to billions who have never had the displeasure of spending 5 minutes inside a bank branch—not to mention something to hedge their livelihoods with.
        <br /><br />
        Decentralised commerce and decentralised finance are undergoing a spurt of exhilarating growth, and both DeCo and DeFi represent the natural order of progress in their industries. There is but one way to go.
        <br /><br />
        The first rays of the new rising sun are dawning on the dreary dystopia of Commerce and Web 2. It’s high time to smell the coffee and get a clue.
