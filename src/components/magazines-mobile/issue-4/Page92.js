        Alot of us know Chainlink for it’s oracles, bridging real world data into the blockchain realms. However, one of the protocols most significant innovations to date is probably it’s most overlooked and unused product; Dynamic NFTs. 
        <br /><br />
        That might twist some delicate part of the inside of your skull. Because, NFTs are immutable right? I mean everything in blockchain ultimately is. Yet, data flows don’t have to be. Securing the pipes shouldn’t preclude the flow of what’s within. And Chainlink is providing a very real solution to this. In fact, it goes beyond providing some cool generative art metadata.
        <br /><br />
        Imagine NFT metadata changing programmatically as real world info about goods, from sales numbers and shipping times to the latest market updates and weather reports shift the context an NFT lives within. It enables a rich metastory as derivative layers of value far beyond the original tracking and timestamping of a good into one unique digital representation has ever allowed for before. 
        <br /><br />
        Synthetic data of NFTs is a completely new paradigm and something that not many projects have been able to comprehend yet alone tap into. The tools just didn’t exist until recently. Think about how revolutionary a very simple mechanistic tool the ticker tape was for economics because by radically simplifying the expression of information through a visual representation, a vast leap in the number and quality of decisions made is enabled. 
        <br /><br />
        And coordinating industry level translations to web3 won’t be possible if the spectrum of visual experience remains static. It’s not enough to have pretty moving images on a loop. It needs to come alive with data. And that’s exactly how we underwrite vitality within the metaverse. We combine the digital with the physical, the on-chain with the off chain. Dynamic NFTs are one of these tools that thread the gap to provide our entry into serving real world use cases.
