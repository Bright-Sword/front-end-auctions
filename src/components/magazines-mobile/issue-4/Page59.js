        Therein lies the rub—because the very system that enables entrepreneurs to reach new markets, clients, and customers are the same ones that weigh them down. Payment processors on the other hand are a constant source of friction for merchants.
        <br /><br />
        It’s a shambles. Online payment systems evolve at the speed of a glacier—and they run antithetical to the industry they claim to support.
        <br /><br />
        Hear me out a second.
        <br /><br />
        New sellers generate lower volumes—and payment processors will only be too happy to part you from your money on constantly increasing prices like a noose tightening around sellers’ necks. Survive if they let you. 
        <br /><br />
        Low volume sellers naturally have no history, and if you plan to sell across borders, you will pay far out the ass on fees. E-commerce platforms want you to grow, but payment processors are seriously weighing you down with sundries left and right. 
        <br /><br />
        Domestic transactions tack on an additional 3-5% in intermediary fees. That isn’t chump change.
        <br /><br />
        Then, another problem inherent in payments are chargebacks, or reversals in favour of the client. These pesky happenstances can occur for legitimate reasons as a result of a glitch in the supply chain matrix, where a merchant couldn’t fulfil an order for any reason. Most of the time, however, chargebacks are fraud-related, meaning a customer couldn’t recognize a payment or their credit card was stolen. That’s wasted time, money, and resources—in the form of lost revenue, a luxury new sellers can ill afford—and that doesn’t exactly paint a bright picture on their brand’s reputation. That’s not to mention the turnaround time with which international payments can be settled, which can take over a week to complete in some cases.
        <br /><br />
        It’s utterly contradictory.
