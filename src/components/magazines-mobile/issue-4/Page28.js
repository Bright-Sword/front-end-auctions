      <p className={styles.text2}>PALM.IO New Energy Efficient NFT Marketplace</p>    
      <p className={styles.text3}>Palm is a new soon to be launching PoS sidechain for Ethereum. It was announced under ConsenSys and is the latest NFT-centric scaling solution to enter the space. It’s an interesting alternative to the Flow blockchain that powers NBA topshot and has enabled significant traditional media exposure around NFTs, carrying in a lot of market expansion through partnerships with big winners from the old economy. It’s too early to tell which operational direction Palm will take, however, its deeps root in Ethereum certainly establishes it as one to watch. Ethereum represents the authentic core of what web3 is all about. It’s an open bazaar that promotes decentralisation through automated incentive systems. Having another scalable NFT platform as part of this ecosystem will surely only strengthen the diversity and vitality that it fosters. 
<br/><br/>
It all leads to the bigger question though; with so many NFT marketplaces launching, who will survive? It’s not to say that there isn’t a market need for more efficient and scalable transactional infrastructure for these digital goods, however, if we don’t continue to increase application and utility use cases alongside sustainable infrastructure development then there will be a lot of highways and not very many cars. 
<br/><br/>
NFTs are guaranteed to eventually become just another feature of the metaverse, and swapping mechanics will be the under the hood invisible components. The startup/tech entrepreneur world often goes through predictable phases like clockwork, and the latest certainly seems to include that of NFT marketplaces. However, the stumble comes when we mistake a feature for a unicorn. Everyone makes a search engine, everyone makes a social media app, everyone makes a Clubhouse... until they realise that ‘it’s just another app on my phone or dial on my radio.’
<br/><br/>
There needs to be a lot more in place than just buy and sell mediums. Communities don’t form and consumer behaviour isn’t driven by the overly technical details of how your system operates. The winning products, platforms, protocols and networks will ultimately be those who best serve the protection against pain and desire for growth of the people they hope will use their services. And ultimately this is what I’m really talking about when it comes to sustainability— it goes far beyond energy efficiency. </p>
