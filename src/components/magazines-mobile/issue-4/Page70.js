      <p className={styles.text2}>Moreover, DeFi protocols like Curve or Compound allow users to lock funds in smart contracts to engage in lending and borrowing activities to generate yields TradFi actors can only dream of. They’re shaking.
      <br/><br/>
E-wallets are fast gaining adoption, and the process of using cryptocurrency wallets has become so much simpler than it used to be. Other DeFi protocols offer debit cards that can be used in day-to-day transactions. This has opened the door to DeFi’s wider adoption.
<br/><br/>
Many investors looking to enter the DeFi space are reluctant to do so because of its volatility. However, collateral-backed stablecoins (pegged to fiat, crypto, or commodities), which are an essential function of DeFi, serve as its operational backbone to guarantee stability amidst potentially wild price swings.
<br/><br/>
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), meanwhile, commodify digital assets and guarantee their authenticity on the immutable blockchain, and their use is extending outside just digital collectibles, but now also as financial products.
<br/><br/>
In the end, the returns from using traditional finance, dysfunctional as it is, just pale in comparison to DeFi—apart from its liquid, composable, and digital nature, only needing an internet connection and a smartphone to get started.
<br/><br/>
TL;DR: DeFi aims to offer financial services to everyone with a smartphone and an internet connection without discrimination, exorbitant fees, and obstacles in an open, trustless, permissionless manner.

The onboarding challenge<br/>
DeFi isn’t without its challenges. The learning curve is steep, and the field is practically in its infancy. And, if you aren’t yet a crypto native, it might take a little more time to get the hang of using DeFi products. Individuals stand to gain tremendous value from DeFi and its related web3 technologies (and their emerging use cases), but onboarding will be necessary for them to take advantage of the opportunities DeFi brings to the table.
<br/><br/>
But beyond the products, protocols, and tech, perhaps we must refocus on solving the onboarding question; and in doing so, focus more on the community, the individuals that should stand to gain the most by participating in it. Mainly, how can it serve them? How can it fulfill their needs? How can it help them attain financial freedom? These are the questions that so many individuals looking at DeFi want to know. It’s not always about coin price, total market capitalization, or chart performance that’s going to lead to widespread adoption. It’s the fundamental question of how it can improve people’s lives.
<br/><br/>
In the end, DeFi is a tool to help capture value that is very much attainable and within their grasp, rather than the end to itself. </p>
