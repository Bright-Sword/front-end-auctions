       <p className={styles.text9}>We often here about all the problems with climate change and the environment, but less emphasis is placed on the relationship between how we are personally impacted and what effective action we can each take to properly do something about it. Carbonbase realised this back in 2019, and alongside that realisation they started building out an entire ecosytem that connects regular consumers with the ability to calculate their carbon footprints and then offset this through investing in certified carbon offset projects from around the world. All of this is incentivised through a meta rewards program, where seed points are earnt from investments and then can be used across a global community of ecosystem partners for various deals and discounts. 
<br/><br/>
It’s not native to the blockchain as of yet, but, it’s an interesting project to highlight either way, especially due to the fact that their global loyalty points program presents a great use case for integration with decentralised incentive systems including that of DeFi. Imagine being able to take your seed points, which could be alikened to a sort of LP token on your investment, and then earn yield through staking, be granted fees from an AMM or, better yet, leverage this up through a lending/borrowing pool to then be able to access an even larger pool of capital for reinvestment into the eco projects and so maximise impact. 
<br/><br/>
DeFi usage for alturistic purposes is still a relatively untouched sector. But, when you start to dig more deeply into the potential of the space, it’s pretty clear just how much more suited the combination of decentralised technologies and crypto incentive models are over traditional finance. This is evident from many aspects, including the more obvious perspective of simply reducing financial friction so that invested funds can reach their destination of intent with transparent verification, and thus, ensure maintenance in the fidelity of what the investment set out to achieve in the first place. And more broadly, that touches on a bigger point of “Why blockchain”— it removes all of the middle opaque crap so that you can do what you set out to do or get what you set out to get under fair conditions. </p>
