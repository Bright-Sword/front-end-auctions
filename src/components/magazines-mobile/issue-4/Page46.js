        We often talk about how valuable our personal data is while at the same time how little we personally value it. Beastly gigantic tech companies grew to their worlds devouring size by feasting on our data while we happily took heart emoji as our consolation prize. The best example of this is Facebook's "Buy, Copy, Kill". And that's exactly they've been doing for the past decade. It's literally killing the entire VR industry right now.

        The big billion dollar buy that kicked off wave after wave of these ecosystem destroying games for narrow gains was of course Instagram.

And there’s nothing you can do about it... yet. We just need to launch those web3 social media apps and do it right this time. Ones that aren’t just copy paste of the legacy apps and transacting on a blockchain and ones that aren’t bought and backed by VCs. The only way to do this right is to have it owned by the users and no one else.
