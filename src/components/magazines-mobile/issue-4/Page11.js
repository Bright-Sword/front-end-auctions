        On the other hand, Etsy has taken down all coronavirus-related merchandise, or otherwise shadowbanned others from its search pages, and famously prevented sales of Washington Redskins merchandise years back because they considered it to have fallen short of their lofty standards of political correctness.
        <br /><br />
        The list goes on. It’s easy to be evil when one institution has all that power (cc: Google and Apple)–hence the calls for demonopolisation.
        <br /><br />
        DeCo seeks to rewire that decision-making process, kicking down the structure, and expelling the costly middleman at every turn of the customer journey.
        <br /><br />
        Removing the middleman also means the removal of fees associated with listing, selling, and using conventional sales-based platforms and the massive overhead they entail. That doesn’t mean participants lack protection, either: this practice allows platforms to keep only the information they need to protect sales. 
        <br /><br />
        DeCo means no sales restrictions, no platform terms and conditions, and no geographic restrictions, and, as is the case with DeFi–trustless. There’s no need for an Amazon, eBay, or Etsy subaltern to oversee and intermediate every single aspect of a sale–DeCo works by directly connecting buyers with sellers, and facilitating transactions through decentralised apps and smart contracts often using cryptocurrency as a means of payment.
