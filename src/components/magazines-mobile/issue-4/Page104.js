        And why not? With one click, anyone with just an internet connection and something to say can support themselves with the myriad of platforms like Patreon and OnlyFans – whether they’re performing for millions of followers or 50 dyed-in-the-wool patrons of the most discerning taste. That’s not to mention income streams arising from ad revenue, paywalls, selling instructional courses, digital content, brand partnerships, and sponsorships. It’s given rise to over 50 million individuals essentially becoming highly sought-after businesses and brands unto themselves.

        The hype is reaching fever pitch as social media platforms left and right engage in total war to retain creators on their platforms, each providing a bevy of incentives, funds, and features to have them stay on. Meanwhile, exciting new startups have come forth out of the fertile environment to provide creators with the tools they need to continue to make their living as the emerging voices and leaders of the communities propagating around every thinkable niche in the nascent web3 plane.

        It hasn’t been smooth sailing for creators by no stretch of the imagination. Like gig economy participants, creators are largely dependent on their relationship with the platform – particularly when it comes to compensation and take rates (and the fast-rising barriers to entry). That’s not to mention the fact that monetisation policy is unilaterally dictated by the platform – there’s no creator bigger than any one platform. Not even the former 45th President and shitposter-in-chief – whose engagement figures should be a success by every imaginable metric – was immune to being de-platformed at the drop of a hat. Cross the bridge, pay the toll. That goes for the centralized platforms that currently hold sway in the nascent creator economy.
