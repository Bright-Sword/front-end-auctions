      <p className={styles.text3}>Most of us remember the craziness of DeFi Summer mid 2020, where we all sat in awe watching the Total Value Locked (TVL) across DeFi protocols exponentially skyrocket from tens of millions to tens of billions in just a few short months. It was an incredibly significant moment for the entirity of the crypto community, where effective usage of blockchain and web3 took a new turn for the better in actually directly being beneficial to a broader retail market, beyond just speculation and hype of new token launches or fancy tech savvy protocols with implementation scheduled for “sometime in the next 2-5 years”. 
<br/><br/>
Before this, a lot of the promise of the applications of web3 technology seemed too far removed from everyday life to have a consequential and serious impact on us, our families and our ability to sustain and continue to level up in increasing our own agency and potentiality for greater opportunity. DeFi changed a lot of this in a real way. It channelled the technology into a use case that made it no longer about the technology, the product, or what the product was doing; but rather, it made it about serving our needs and helping us get to where we wanted to go with less friction, less barriers, less need to worry about gatekeepers. So, for this edition of Web3 Wizards we take our hats off to those that pioneered the industry before anyone really even knew what it was. </p>
