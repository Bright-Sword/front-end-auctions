        Just last August, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos officially became the richest individual in the world, with a fortune exceeding that of oil and resource-rich Qatar’s gross domestic product—or roughly over $210 billion. It’s the largest known fortune in existence today.

        Ever since Amazon launched in 1994, Bezos’ grand vision for Amazon was to become the preeminent all-encompassing marketplace the likes of which had never been seen before. And it’s already come to fruition. Bezos made his bones building Amazon into the multibillion-dollar powerhouse that it is, much in line with his goal of creating the only marketplace people would ever need.
        <br /><br />
        Since then, Amazon has constantly broken new highs and reached new milestones, as it has dominated and cornered entire markets, as they aggressively pursue the creation of an entire ecosystem built around its e-commerce platform that traverses every sphere of our economic lives.

      <div className={styles.text4}>
        Each year, Amazon achieves new heights—dominating entire industries, dipping its fingers into logistics, cloud computing, live streaming, artificial intelligence, all the way to financial services, relentlessly pushing the envelope on expanding its virtual stranglehold on commerce through constant market tinkering while throwing its ample weight around as the undisputed 600-pound gorilla of the Commerce 2.0 jungle.
        <br /><br />
        Let’s put it this way—it’s not Santa’s Little Elves who ensure you get your next purchase within 2 days. Rather, the retail giant fulfills orders through its vast network of fulfillment centers scattered across the globe, where hundreds of thousands of employees work tirelessly in downright exploitative circumstances.
        <br /><br />
        As 19th century French novelist and playwright Honoré de Balzac was once reported to have quipped: behind every great fortune is an equally great crime. And to the myriad ex-Amazon employees who have had to take piss breaks in bottles in a toxic workplace where productivity is measured by the literal minute—the Amazon bigwig has a lot to account for. Namely, the obscene fact that a man making almost $4000 a second can’t do anything to raise the company’s $15 minimum wage to a reasonable, acceptable standard—even as Amazon made record sales in the middle of the worst pandemic in recent history.
        <br /><br />
        This wasn’t lost on disgruntled Amazon ex-employees that rolled out a prop guillotine outside Bezos’ mansion, calling for his head figuratively (if not literally) the day after the news about Bezos’ becoming the wealthiest man alive came out. The same ones that helped build Amazon to the retail powerhouse that it is—the salt of the earth that runs the whole damn fulfillment layer.
        <br /><br />
        It’s understandable why there would be some outrage over the whole shebang, particularly when Bezos went to space and put his foot in his mouth thanking every Amazon employee and customer for subsidizing his intergalactic joyride on Blue Origin.
        <br /><br />
        We can all play armchair quarterback endlessly about the semantics of his expression of gratitude. But in light of the labor conditions that Amazon rank and file go through, as well as its corporate culture and reports of unethical practices, it came across as a bad joke.
